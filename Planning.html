					<h2>Creating an open data strategy</h2>
					<p>An organisation’s open data strategy is a practical document that identifies how the government’s
						commitment to open data applies within an individual organisation.
					</p>
					<p>Organisations can use their open data strategies to identify the value they put on open data, how
						they will act on open data commitments, the data that will and won’t be made available (for
						example, data may be withheld for privacy or national security purposes), how they will interact
						with open data stakeholders such as contractors and data users, and an indicative order and
						timetable for the data to be made available.
						If you are creating an open data strategy for your own organisation, the examples below and the
						open data self-assessment will help to identify the best strategic open data goals for your
						organisation based on the level of progress to date. The page on choosing data sets to publish
						may also be useful for prioritising the publication of your organisation’s data.

					<p>The Queensland Government has published its open data strategies for others to learn from. See
						the website for strategies you can use as a guide.

							href="mailto:spatial@communications.gov.au">spatial@communications.gov.au</a> and we will
						add your strategy to this page.
					</p>
					<h2>Choosing data sets to publish</h2>
					<h3><span id="What_data_should_be_published?"></span>What data should be published?</h3>
					<p>Open data is about giving open access to data that is:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Structured – the data is recorded in a uniform way based on a common model. This can be as
							simple as a spreadsheet with rules around how the data is recorded. For example, if one of
							the inputs is the state or territory that a program is run in, there could be a rule that
							the state is recorded as ‘WA’ rather than ‘Western Australia’ or ‘Wstn Aus’. See <a
								href="Publishing_your_data.html#Creating_datasets" title="Publishing your data">creating
								data sets</a> for more information about structuring data.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>Machine readable – the data is digitised and available in a format that can be read
							automatically by machines for retrieval, downloading, indexing and searching. See <a
								href="Publishing_your_data.html#Saved_in_an_open_format"
								title="Publishing your data">data formats</a> for more information about machine
							readable formats.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>Licenced to minimise the limits on how people can use and redistribute the data. See <a
								href="Publishing_your_data.html#Licensing_your_data"
								title="Publishing your data">licencing your data</a> for more information.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>There are three broad data types found in Government Agencies:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Raw data generated out of business as usual activities – such as spatial data from a
							program, energy ratings data, crime statistics, administration data, etc. Often this data is
							stored in databases and primarily used in business applications.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>Processed data – new data that results from a process such as tables from annual reports,
							FOI logs, other data generated for the functions and running of agencies. This could also be
							an aggregate view of a raw data set, fit for public access.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>System data – data that is automatically generated from other processes such as web
							analytics, project management, access logs and other systems.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Identifying different data across your organisation means getting out of the traditional data
						teams and looks at other datasets that exist and how you can leverage them to improve services,
						policies and efficiencies.
					</p>
					<h3><span id="How_should_I_prioritise_data?"></span>How should I prioritise data?</h3>
					<p>If your organisation is looking for data to start publishing, you can identify popular or easily
						opened data sets by:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Analysing FOI, Parliamentary and external helpdesk requests for common requests. This could
							help to reduce time and resources spent on providing the same data to individual requests,
							as well as identifying popular data sets for publication.</li>
						<li>Looking at information the agency already publishes, either in data form or PDF form, for
							some quick results. Publishing the data on data.gov.au will improve accessibility, reuse,
							discoverability and the ability for your agency to reuse the data. For example, the tables
							from your annual report, budget, grants, administrative data or mandatory reporting are all
							useful.</li>
						<li>Assessing what data sets exist across your agency and identifying a top 10 that would
							provide greater economic, transparency or policy benefits if made publicly available.</li>
						<li>Identify where you need data to deliver a new service or application and consider making the
							data feed publicly available to cut costs in your service delivery and to enable external
							services based on your data.</li>
						<li>In all new systems consider the data that is created and how you can best reuse and
							appropriate expose the data from the start.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Your entity’s priorities for opening data should be identified as part of a broader open data
						strategy.
					</p>
					<h3>Sourcing data for publication</h3>
					<p>A core theme of the current policies that address the management of public sector information is
						that government information should be managed as a national resource and made available for
						reuse unless there are good reasons not to (eg the data could identify individuals). To achieve
						this, your organisation can:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Consider whether upcoming publications contain information that is suitable for release in
							an open data format. Many government reports include agency data about financial, economic,
							social or regulatory activity or trends, but present the data in formats unsuited to reuse
							(eg publishing spreadsheets in a PDF file rather than a reusable spread sheet format). To
							fix this, consider publishing the underlying raw data alongside the report in a reusable
							open data format.
							<ul>
								<li>For example, as part of the budget process the Government now publishes <a
										rel="nofollow" class="external text"
										href="http://data.gov.au/dataset/budget-2014-15-tables-and-data">financial data
										from the portfolio budget statements</a> in a reusable format on data.gov.au in
									addition to the statements themselves which are available on departmental websites.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Consider whether agency websites and mobile apps that present information to the public
							could also be released in data form. For example, the <a rel="nofollow"
								class="external text" href="http://humanservices.findnearest.com.au/">Department of
								Human Services’ (DHS) Service Locator tool</a> allows people to find their nearest
							Centrelink, Medicare or Child Support location. DHS released the <a rel="nofollow"
								class="external text"
								href="http://data.gov.au/organization/departmentofhumanservices">raw Service Locator
								geospatial data</a> on data.gov.au. This makes the data available to the public to build
							their own apps using the data. <br />Another example is the Department of Finance’s release
							of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
								href="http://data.gov.au/dataset/historical-australian-government-contract-data">historical
								government contract data</a> from the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
								href="http://www.tenders.gov.au/?event=public.reports.listCNWeeklyExport">AusTender
								website</a> on data.gov.au.</li>
						<li>Assess whether any material they have already published online in publications, websites or
							apps is suitable for release as open data. This could include material published as part of
							the FOI Act Information Publication Scheme or in an agency disclosure log.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Case studies</h2>
					<p>The collection of links below demonstrate the breadth and value of the ways that data.gov.au and
						other open data resources are currently used. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://data.gov.au/related">Government Data Use Cases</a> on data.gov.au are also an
						excellent resource for understanding how data from data.gov.au can be used.
					</p>
					<h3>National Map</h3>
					<p>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://nationalmap.research.nicta.com.au/">National Map</a> is a website for map-based
						access to Australian spatial data from government agencies. It is designed to:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Provide easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and the
							public</li>
						<li>Facilitate the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies</li>
						<li>Provide an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community
							innovation</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Trove</h3>
					<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/">Trove</a> brings together
						content from libraries, museums, archives and other research organisations with tools to explore
						and build. Trove is a growing repository of full text digital resources, but it is also an
						aggregation of metadata for users to build upon, a set of services, and a community in its own
						right.
					</p>
					<h3>Energy Rating Tools</h3>
					<p>A joint initiative of Australian Commonwealth, State and Territory and New Zealand governments
						has produced an energy efficiency dataset for over seven million major household appliances sold
						in Australia and New Zealand every year.
						The Department of Industry has used this data to create a <a rel="nofollow"
							class="external text"
							href="http://www.energyrating.gov.au/for-consumers/energy-ratings-mobile-app/">mobile
							app</a> to help households choose energy efficient appliances.
						The dataset has also been built upon for private projects such as the <a rel="nofollow"
							class="external text" href="http://energycalculator.meteor.com/">energy calculator</a>
						created by Jonathon Moffatt and Wai Liu for GovHack 2014.
					</p>
					<p>Opening the energy ratings data has:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Created an automatically-created API (Application Program Interface) for the dataset from
							data.gov.au, saving the cost of commissioning an API and purchasing the servers to host the
							dataset</li>
						<li>Helped retailers to automatically update the Energy Rating Labels of appliances for sale on
							their website and reduce the risk of a Trade Practices Act breach for displaying inaccurate
							or misleading rating information</li>
						<li>Empowered the community to build on the data. A range of GovHack 2014 projects demonstrated
							the potential to mix energy rating data with other datasets for great outcomes, including
							the prototype for the Energy Calculator and Comparison Tool, which demonstrated the
							potential to use the energy rating dataset to help households crunch the costs of their
							appliances.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Big Data</h2>
					<h3>The Australian Public Service Big Data Strategy</h3>
					<p>As indicated in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://www.finance.gov.au/policy-guides-procurement/ict_strategy_2012_2015">APS ICT
							Strategy</a>, the Department of Finance has developed a Big Data Strategy which sets out the
						actions that the Government is taking to harness the opportunities afforded by big data without
						compromising the privacy of individuals.
					</p>
					<p>The Strategy, which has been endorsed by the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://www.finance.gov.au/governance-awards-data/sigb/">Secretaries' ICT Governance
							Board</a>, provides a whole-of-government (WofG) approach to big data in order to enhance
						services, deliver new services and provide better policy advice, while incorporating best
						practice privacy protections and leveraging existing ICT investments.

								Strategy (PDF 557 KB)</a></li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Australian Public Service Better Practice Guide for Big Data</h3>
					<p>The APS Better Practice Guide for Big Data aims to support the adoption of big data analytics by
						Australian Government agencies. The Guide provides advice to agencies on key considerations for
						adopting and using big data. It also aims to assist agencies make better use of their data
						assets whilst ensuring that the Government continues to protect the privacy rights of
						individuals and security of information.

					<h3>Whole-of-Government Data Analytics Centre of Excellence</h3>
					<p>The WofG Data Analytics Centre of Excellence (CoE) was established by the Australian Taxation
						Office as a space to build analytics capability across government. The purpose of the CoE is to
						enable a common capability framework for analytics, as well as an opportunity to share technical
						knowledge, skills and tools. The CoE also helps build collaborative arrangements with tertiary
						institutions to aid the development of analytics professionals. The CoE has developed a website
						which provides information about data analytics at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
