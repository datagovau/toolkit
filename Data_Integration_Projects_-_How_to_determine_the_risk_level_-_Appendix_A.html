					<h1>Purpose</h1>
					<p>The purpose of this appendix is to demonstrate through a case study, the process of determining
						the post mitigation risk rating of data integration projects using the draft risk framework
						guidelines. A practical example is provided in this document with both pre- and post- mitigation
						risks.
					</p>
					<h1>Definitions</h1>
					<p>For the purpose of classifying data integration projects, the following definitions are used:
					</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<th>Project Types
								</th>
								<th>Definition
								</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Single agency
								</td>
								<td>There is only one Commonwealth data custodian involved in the data integration
									project.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Multiple agencies
								</td>
								<td>There is more than one Commonwealth data custodian involved in the data integration
									project.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Non-Commonwealth
								</td>
								<td>There is one or more non-Commonwealth data custodian involved in the data
									integration project.
								</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<h1>Risks at different stages of the project</h1>
					<p>There are varying levels of risks associated with the different stages of a data integration
						project. Broadly, the stages include extraction, file transfer, linkage, analysis, publication,
						storage and destruction. Not all stages will be applicable to all data integration projects. For
						example, a data integration project may retain the linked dataset indefinitely. Therefore, the
						destruction stage may not be applicable.
					</p>
					<p>Mitigation strategies can be applied at various stages to reduce the likelihood of a breach
						occurring. The data integration project can be designed in such a way that even if the
						consequence of a breach occurring is high, the likelihood is reduced such that the project does
						not require an accredited Integrating Authority. For example, even if the data required for the
						integration project are sensitive, using the separation principle may mean that the project does
						not necessarily require an accredited Integrating Authority.
					</p>
					<h1>Application of the framework through a selected case study</h1>
					<p>The following section provides a case study of pre- and post-mitigation assessments. The final
						risk assessment can assist in determining whether an accredited Integrating Authority is
						required or not.
					</p>
					<p>The selected case study is:
					</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<th>#</th>
								<th>Type of case study</th>
								<th>Project Name
								</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>4.1</td>
								<td>High Risk – Single agency</td>
								<td>Client Data Collection (DSS)
								</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<p>Case studies from other agencies will be included later. This will help ensure the framework
						continues to be developed in a way that is fit for all situations.
					</p>
					<h2><span id="High_Risk_–_Single_agency"></span>High Risk – Single agency</h2>
					<p>Client Data Collection (CDC) data integration project (DSS)
						Department of Social Services (DSS) proposed Client Data Collection (CDC) is an example of a
						high risk single agency project. DSS is the sole data custodian. In this case, DSS is also the
						integrating authority.
					</p>
					<p>The purpose of the CDC project is to enable better monitoring and research within and between DSS
						programs and payments data. This project is still in the planning stage. The following
						strategies are hypothetical and subject to change.
					</p>
					<h3>Pre-mitigation Assessment</h3>
					<p>There are three dimensions that influence the consequence of a breach (from the eight risk
						dimensions agreed upon). The table below outlines the consequence (or impact) on individuals if
						there is a breach.
					</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<th>Dimension</th>
								<th>Impact</th>
								<th>Comments
								</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<th>Sensitivity
								</th>
								<td>High
								</td>
								<td>The project involves integrating all DSS programs and payments data. Information
									collected includes educational background, health status, income level and much
									more. The data is considered to be highly sensitive. If leaked, there is the
									potential to cause harm to individuals and the Commonwealth Government as a whole.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<th>Consent
								</th>
								<td>High
								</td>
								<td>Some of the programs directly obtain consent (Endnote 17) from clients. However, the
									majority of them do not. Generally, both programs and payments data are collected as
									an administrative by-product.
								</td>

									<p>At this stage, external output is not proposed.

					<p>Based on the above assessment, this project is classified as ‘high’ risk. The data is highly
						sensitive, with a large number of identifiable variables on both the programs and payments data.
						Having assessed the initial risk, DSS can now take actions to reduce the risk of undertaking
						this project.
					</p>
					<h3>Post-mitigation Assessment</h3>
					<p>There are a number of things that can be done to mitigate against the likelihood of a breach
						occurring. The data integration project can be designed in such a way that even if the
						consequence of a breach occurring is high, the likelihood is reduced such that the project does
						not require an accredited Integration Authority.
						These are the mitigation strategies applied to reduce the consequence risk:
					</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<th>Elements</th>
								<th>Reducing the likelihood of a breach occurring in the first place
								</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<th>Sensitivity
								</th>
								<td>Initially, the data is assessed as highly sensitive. However, the project design is
									such that the entire dataset is not required. The separation principle plays a big
									role here.
									<p>It is proposed that a SLK would be created for programs and payments data using
										the same algorithm. This would negate the need for access to variables that are
										highly sensitive on the original dataset.
										A file with the record identifier between the programs and payments data would
										be retained. This means that the linked file would not contain any sensitive
										data.
										Only if a research request is approved would they be given access to the linked
										dataset.
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>DSS already has processes in place to handle research requests.</li>
										<li>All internal research requests would also need to go through an approval
											stage.</li>
									</ul>
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<th>Consent
								</th>
								<td>The data being linked is all an administrative by-product. The purpose of this
									linking activity is to analyse client pathways through the whole social security
									system to improve programs and policies.
									<p>Ultimately, this is the objective of the organisation and thus this project is a
										strategic move to enable us to provide sound policy advice and better design our
										programs to achieve quality outcomes.
									</p>
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<th>Amount of information about a data provider
								</th>
								<td>Linkage stage:
									<p>It is proposed that only five or fewer variables be used to create the SLK. These
										would include variables such as:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Name (surname and given name)</li>
										<li>Sex</li>
										<li>Date of Birth</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Storage stage:
									</p>
									<p>The linked file would only contain the SLK, weight (the strength indicator of the
										link) and record identifier. There is only one quasi-identifying variable in the
										linked file, as an SLK includes date of birth. This is not enough for
										identification.
									</p>
									<p>Analysis stage:
									</p>
									<p>Researchers (internal) would need to go through an approval stage and access
										would only be granted once it can be shown that the public benefit of the
										research outweigh the risk.
									</p>
									<p>Throughout the separation principle is applied.

										the content data for the researcher. In the first stage, only four variables are
										needed to create the SLK (and SLK in itself cannot spontaneously identify an

									</p>
									<p>In the second stage, the extraction of content data for research purposes is
										already subject to systems that protect the privacy of data providers and
										confidentiality of data, including protective security measures.

										established, there are no security issues involved with file transfer.

										variable (date of birth) used in the linkage stage.

										established practices and Protective Security. No name data is provided for
										analysis.

					<p>In this particular case, an accredited Integrating Authority is not required (Endnote 18)

						17 Here clients gave consent for the information to be collected for statistical purposes.
					</p>
					<p>18 It is worth noting that an accredited Integrating Authority may also introduce an increased
						element of risk. Mitigation strategies would be required to address the introduced risk. For
						example, if an accredited Integrating Authority is required, then an extra file transfer stage
						is introduced. There would need to be mitigation strategies to minimise the introduced risk.
