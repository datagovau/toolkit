					<h1>Glossary</h1>
					<h2>Administrative data</h2>
					<p>Information (including personal information) collected by agencies for the administration of
						programs, policies or services and with the potential to be used for statistical purposes.
						Administrative data is one type of microdata.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Aggregate data</h2>
					<p>Aggregate data are produced by grouping information into categories and aggregating values within
						these categories. For example, a count of the number of people of a particular age (obtained
						from the question ‘In what year were you born?’).
					</p>
					<p>Aggregate data is typically presented in tables. Aggregate data is also referred to as tabular
						data or macrodata.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Anonymised data</h2>
					<p>This term is most commonly used to refer to data from which direct identifiers have been removed
						(de-identified data), but it is sometimes also used to refer to confidentialised data. To avoid
						confusion the more specific terms de-identified data and confidentialised data are used in the
						Confidentiality Information Series.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Cell concentration rule</h2>
					<p>See Cell dominance rule.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Cell dominance rule</h2>
					<p>A rule commonly applied to cells in a table to assess whether a cell may enable identification.
						The cell dominance rule (also called the cell concentration rule) is used to identify cells
						where a small number of data providers contribute a large percentage to the cell. If a cell
						fails this rule further investigation or action is needed to ensure that identification is
						unlikely.
					</p>
					<p>For more information see <a
							href="Confidentiality_-_How_to_confidentialise_data_the_basic_principles.html"
							title="Confidentiality - How to confidentialise data the basic principles">Confidentiality
							Information Sheet 4: ‘How to confidentialise data: the basic principles’</a>.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Confidential data</h2>
					<p>Data that will allow identification of an individual or organisation, either directly or
						indirectly.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Confidentialise</h2>
					<p>To remove or alter information, or collapse detail within a dataset, to ensure that no person or
						organisation is likely to be identified in the data (directly or indirectly).
					</p>
					<p>For more information see <a href="Confidentiality_-_What_is_it_and_why_is_it_important.html"
							title="Confidentiality - What is it and why is it important">Confidentiality Information
							Sheet 1: 'Confidentiality: what is it and why is it important?’</a> and <a

					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2><span id="Confidentialised_Unit_Record_Files_(CURFs)"></span>Confidentialised Unit Record Files
						(CURFs)</h2>
					<p>Confidentialised Unit Record Files (CURFs) are files containing microdata that have been
						de-identified and modified to protect individuals or organisations from either direct or
						indirect identification.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
					<p><q>An obligation to the provider of information to maintain the secrecy of that information.</q>
					</p>
					<p>Source: UN Economic Commission for Europe, 2009
					</p>
					<p>For more information see <a href="Confidentiality_-_What_is_it_and_why_is_it_important.html"

							Sheet 1: ‘Confidentiality: what is it and why is it important?’</a>
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Confidentiality rules</h2>
					<p>Rules that are applied to each cell in a table to identify table cells that pose a risk of
						identification (disclosure). Two common rules are the frequency rule and the cell dominance
						rule.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Data custodian</h2>
					<p>The organisation or agency which is responsible for the collection, use and disclosure of
						information in a dataset. Data custodians have an obligation to keep the confidential
						information they are entrusted with secret.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Data laboratories</h2>
					<p>On-site data laboratories provide access to detailed microdata at a secure site controlled by the
						data custodian.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Data modification</h2>
					<p>See <a href="Confidentiality_-_Glossary.html#Perturbation">#Perturbation</a>.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Data provider</h2>
					<p>An individual, household, business or other organisation which supplies data either for
						statistical or administrative purposes.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Data reduction</h2>
					<p>A technique used to confidentialise data. Data reduction methods aim to control or limit the
						amount of detail available to avoid identification of a particular individual or business. Data
						reduction methods include combining categories of information or suppressing information for
						unsafe cells.
					</p>
					<p>For more information about techniques to confidentialise data see: Confidentiality Information
						Sheet 4: ‘How to confidentialise data: the basic principles'.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Data rounding</h2>
					<p>Involves slightly altering small cells in a table to ensure results from analysis based on the
						data are not significantly affected, but the original values cannot be known with certainty.
						Data rounding may be random or controlled.
					</p>
					<p>For more information about data rounding techniques see: Confidentiality Information Sheet 4:
						‘How to confidentialise data: the basic principles'.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>De-identified data</h2>
					<p>Data that have had any identifiers removed. May also be referred to as unidentified data.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Direct identification</h2>
					<p>Occurs when a direct identifier is included with the data that can be used to establish the
						identity of an individual or organisation.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Disclosure</h2>
					<p>Disclosure occurs when a person or an organisation recognises or learns something that they did
						not already know about another person or organisation through released data.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Disclosure control</h2>
					<p>Managing the risks of an individual or organisation being identified either directly or
						indirectly.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Frequency rule</h2>
					<p>A rule commonly applied to cells in a table to assess whether a cell may enable identification.
						The frequency rule (also called the threshold rule) sets a threshold value for the minimum
						number of individuals or businesses in any cell. Common threshold values are 3, 5 and 10. If a
						cell fails this rule further investigation or action is needed to ensure that identification is
						unlikely.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Identifiable</h2>
					<p>Able to be identified either directly or indirectly.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Identification</h2>
					<p>See <a href="Confidentiality_-_Glossary.html#Direct_identification">#Direct identification</a>,
						<a href="Confidentiality_-_Glossary.html#Identified_data">#Identified data</a> and <a
							href="Confidentiality_-_Glossary.html#Indirect_identification">#Indirect identification</a>.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Identified data</h2>
					<p>Data that include an identifier.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2><span id="Identifier(s)"></span>Identifier(s)</h2>
					<p>An identifier (direct identifier) is information that directly establishes the identity of an
						individual or organisation. Examples of identifiers are: name, address, driver's licence number,
						Medicare number and Australian Business Number.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Indirect identification</h2>
					<p>Occurs when the identity of an individual or organisation is disclosed, not through the use of
						direct identifiers, but through a combination of unique characteristics.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Macrodata</h2>
					<p>See <a href="Confidentiality_-_Glossary.html#Aggregate_data">#Aggregate data</a>.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Microdata</h2>
					<p>Unit record data where each record represents observations for an individual or organisation.
						Unit record data may contain individual responses to questions on a survey questionnaire or
						administrative forms. For example, answers given to the question ‘In what year were you born?’.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Outlier</h2>
					<p>An unusual value that is correctly reported but is not typical of the rest of the population.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Personal information</h2>
					<p><q>Information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database),
							whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual
							whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or
							opinion.</q> (Privacy Act 1988)
					</p>
					<p>Personal information is information that identifies, or could identify a person. There are some
						obvious examples of personal information, such as name or address. Personal information can also
						include medical records, bank account details, photos, videos, and even information about what a
						person likes, their opinions and where they work - basically, any information through which
						person is reasonably identifiable.
					</p>
					<p>Information does not have to include a name to be personal information. For example, in some
						cases, date of birth and post code may be enough to identify someone.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Perturbation</h2>
					<p>A technique used to confidentialise data. Perturbation is a data modification method that
						involves changing the data slightly to reduce the risk of disclosure while retaining as much
						content and structure as possible.
					</p>
					<p>Perturbation techniques include data rounding or data swapping.
					</p>
					<p>For further information about techniques to confidentialise data see:
						[[Confidentiality_-_How_to_confidentialise_data_the_basic_principles|Confidentiality Information
						Sheet 4: ‘How to confidentialise data: the basic principles'\\.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Privacy</h2>
					<p>The individual’s right to have their personal information managed so that it is kept confidential
						except where informed consent has been given to release the information, or a legal authority
						exists, in accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Provider</h2>
					<p>An individual, household, business or other organisation which provides data either to
						statistical collections or administrative collections. May also be referred to as a respondent.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Record attack</h2>
					<p>Occurs when a user tries to find a particular person or organisation with a set of
						characteristics known to the user.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Remote access facility</h2>
					<p>Remote access facilities are used by agencies around the world to enable approved researchers to
						submit data queries through a secure internet-based interface from their desktop. The request is
						run against a confidentialised unit record file, which is securely stored within the data
						custodian's computing environment.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Remarkable characteristics</h2>
					<p>The presence of a rare characteristic in the data can pose an identification risk, depending on
						how remarkable (or extraordinary or noticeable) the characteristic is. This might include people
						in unusual jobs, very large families or young people with very high educational qualifications.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Risk management</h2>
					<p>In the context of confidentiality, risk management involves identification and management of the
						risk of disclosure in accordance with the impact and likelihood of a disclosure occurring and
						within the constraints provided by legislation and policies.
					</p>
					<p>Further information about the process of managing microdata disclosure risks is in <a
							href="Confidentiality_-_Managing_the_risk_of_disclosure_in_the_release_of_microdata.html"
							title="Confidentiality - Managing the risk of disclosure in the release of microdata">Confidentiality
							Information Sheet 5: 'Confidentiality: managing the risks of disclosure in microdata’</a>.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Security</h2>
					<p>Safe storage and access to held data, including physical security of buildings and IT security.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Spontaneous recognition</h2>
					<p>An identification made without any deliberate attempt.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Statistical purposes</h2>
					<p>Purposes which support the collection, storage, compilation, analysis and transformation of data
						for the production of statistical output, and the dissemination of those outputs and the
						information describing them.
					</p>
					<p>This means that information cannot be used for administrative, regulatory, law enforcement or
						other purpose that affects the rights, privileges or benefits of particular individuals or
						organisations.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Suppression</h2>
					<p>Data suppression involves not releasing information that is considered unsafe because it fails
						confidentiality rules being applied.
					</p>
					<p>For further information about techniques to suppress data see: <a
							href="Confidentiality_-_How_to_confidentialise_data_the_basic_principles.html"
							title="Confidentiality - How to confidentialise data the basic principles">Confidentiality

					</p>
					<h2>Uniqueness</h2>
					<p>Used to characterise the situation where an individual can be distinguished from all other
						members in a population or sample in terms of information available on microdata records. The
						existence of uniqueness is determined by the size of the population or sample, the degree to
						which it is segmented by geographic information and the number and detail of characteristics
						provided for each unit in the dataset.
