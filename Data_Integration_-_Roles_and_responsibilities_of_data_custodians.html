					</p>
					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					<p>1. This paper identifies the rights, responsibilities and roles of data custodians relative to
						those of the other key participants in data integration projects involving Commonwealth data for
						statistical and research purposes, namely integrating authorities and users of integrated
						datasets.
						Who is a data custodian?
					</p>
					<p>2. Data custodians are agencies responsible for managing the use, disclosure and protection of
						source data used in a statistical data integration project. Data custodians collect and hold
						information on behalf of a data provider (defined as an individual, household, business or other
						organisation which supplies data either for statistical or administrative purposes). The role of
						data custodians may also extend to producing source data, in addition to their role as a holder
						of datasets.
					</p>
					<p>3. For any given data integration project (or family of projects) involving Commonwealth data,
						there may be one or more data custodians (Endnote 1) . These may be from the same organisation
						or from separate institutions, will include at least one Commonwealth agency, and may include
						state/territory agencies and non-government organisations such as universities and private
						sector businesses.
					</p>
					<h1>Commonwealth data integration arrangements</h1>
					<p>4. Figure 1 is a stylised representation of the interactions between data custodians, integrating
						authorities, and data users around data integration arrangements that involve the use of at
						least one Commonwealth dataset for statistical and research purposes. The figure shows the key
						factors which data custodians need to consider before releasing data to an integrating
						authority, namely:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Existing legislation which enables the release of, and access to, data by integrating
							authorities (i.e., legislation which applies to data custodians and integrating
							authorities).</li>
						<li>Privacy impacts relating to the use and disclosure of personal information or business data.
							This may include an assessment against the Commonwealth Privacy Act and equivalent
							state/territory or other legislation. Agency-specific legislation will also need to be
							considered.</li>
						<li>The existence of any data protocols governing access to, and the use of, datasets. An
							example is the need for ethics committee approval for projects using human research data
							(e.g., clinical trials, population health research and health services data).</li>
						<li>Ensuring that the data integration project takes into account the public benefit which can
							be derived from the use of integrated datasets.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>5. The choice of integrating authority will be based on a consultative process led by the data
						custodians taking into account any preferences of the data users. Data custodian need to give in
						principle approval for the project to proceed before an integrating authority is appointed. Data
						custodian(s) remain individually accountable for the source data used in statistical data
						integration projects (refer to the Commonwealth’s Statistical Integration Principle 2 –
						Custodian’s Accountability) and must ultimately be satisfied with the chosen integrating
						authority.
					</p>
					<p>6. Commonwealth data custodians are required to address all of these factors. The requirements
						will vary among different data custodians as indicated in Figure 1.

					</p>
					<h1>The rights and responsibilities of data custodians</h1>
					<p>7. Data custodians have a number of ‘rights and responsibilities’ related to the release of, and
						access to, source datasets for data integration projects. These form the basis for how data
						custodians will work collaboratively with other participants involved in data integration
						projects.
					</p>
					<p>8. The key rights and responsibilities of data custodians in relation to integrating authorities
						are listed below.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It is the responsibility of data custodians to ensure they are authorised by legislation or
							consent to release identifiable data to an integrating authority. The data custodians must
							also be satisfied that the integrating authority has the necessary legislative protections
							in place prohibiting disclosure of identifiable data, before the commencement of a data
							integration project.</li>
						<li>If a data custodian approves a project, the data custodian will need to provide data to the
							relevant integrating authority for that project. Data will be protected and safely managed
							by the integrating authority throughout the project life cycle and in accordance with any
							requirements of data custodians.</li>
						<li>It is the responsibility of data custodians to ensure good data management practices,
							(including clear documentation, the use of standard definitions and classifications, the
							maintenance of appropriate metadata, and quality assurance) are undertaken before data is
							provided to an integrating authority.</li>
						<li>It is the right of data custodians to have data linkage, merging and access services
							provided on their behalf by an integrating authority.</li>
						<li>Where the Cross Portfolio Data Integration Oversight Board advises on amendments to ‘high
							risk’ (Endnote 2) projects (or where a concern is raised), data custodians, the integrating
							authority and data users will need to collaborate on how to make improvements to such
							project(s).</li>
						<li>Data custodians may collaborate with integrating authorities on the content of training
							material provided to data users. Input, advice and assistance will be provided at the
							discretion of data custodians.</li>
						<li>Data custodians are responsible for consulting with the integrating authority about the
							information the integrating authority will provide when registering the project on the
							Public Register of Data Integration Projects.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>9. Data custodians also have rights and responsibilities in relation to data users.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Data custodians are responsible, along with the integrating authority for consulting with
							data users on any material changes or updates to a data integration project (regardless of
							whether changes originate from data custodians or integrating authorities). This will occur
							before data users start examining integrated datasets. Possible issues raised by integrating
							authorities may include the technical feasibility of the project or the limitations of data
							use.</li>
						<li>Data custodians may provide input, advice and assistance to integrating authorities on the
							content of training material.</li>
						<li>Data custodians can expect that data users are aware of, and understand, sanctions which
							apply for attempts to identify (or re-identify) individuals or organisations; disseminating
							outputs that enable the identification of individuals or organisations; or the misuse of
							data.</li>
						<li>It is the right of data custodians to approve or disapprove project proposals, in whole or
							in part (this decision could be influenced by the technical feasibility assessment made by
							the integrating authorities). Data custodians also have the right to prioritise and schedule
							data extraction work associated with project proposals, taking account of the range of data
							extraction requests that may be outstanding at the time. Data custodians are responsible for
							informing data users of these outcomes.</li>
						<li>Data custodians may collaborate with data users and integrating authorities on how to make
							improvements to ‘high risk’ project(s), based on advice provided by the Cross Portfolio Data
							Integration Oversight Board.</li>
						<li>Data custodians have a right to implement cost recovery policies (to recover the costs of
							preparing and extracting datasets, for example) for data integration projects. Note: cost
							recovery by Commonwealth agencies must comply with the Australian Government Cost Recovery
							Guidelines (July 2005) published by the Department of Finance and Deregulation.</li>
						<li>Data custodians and data users are responsible for ensuring that datasets are used for the
							approved purposes only. This is facilitated by practices which help avoid the
							misinterpretation of data. Examples include the supply of appropriate metadata by data
							custodians and the testing of assumptions made in respect of the data by researchers.</li>
					</ul>
					<h1>The role of data custodians in data integration projects</h1>
					<p>10. Data custodians have six key roles in the Commonwealth data integration arrangements. These
						roles reflect the need for data custodians to strike a balance between maximising the inherent
						value of data assets and minimising privacy concerns associated with the use of this data. The
						roles are:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Safe storage of unit record level information;</li>
						<li>Assessing the level of risk for each data integration project;</li>
						<li>Ensuring compliance with relevant legislation, including privacy, for data release;</li>
						<li>Entering into agreements with integrating authorities;</li>
						<li>Safe transmission of data; and</li>
						<li>Maximising the value of data holdings.</li>
					</ul>
					<h1><span id="(1)_Safe_storage_of_unit_record_level_information"></span>(1) Safe storage of unit
						record level information</h1>
					<p>11. Data custodians must have policies and procedures in place which contain information on how
						data custodians will interact with integrating authorities and data users, along with the rights
						and obligations that exist, to ensure the safe storage of unit record level information.
						Examples include communication, information security, training and governance strategies.
					</p>
					<p>12. The safe storage of unit record data should be considered along with quality assurance. Data
						custodians must ensure, as far as practicable, the accuracy, currency and timeliness of data
						supplied to an integrating authority. The need to ensure data quality aligns with the high level
						statistical integration principles, which specify the importance of data custodians following
						good data management practices and maintaining the quality attributes of data (Endnote 3). For
						personal information, it is also consistent with Information Privacy Principle 8 of the Privacy
						Act 1988 which states the record-keeper (i.e. the data custodian) is responsible for checking
						the accuracy and completeness of personal information before it is used. Equivalent principles
						for business data should also be considered.
					</p>
					<p>13. Quality assurance is an essential step to help minimise any potential problems which may
						arise with integrated datasets. Good data management practices include the provision of clear
						documentation, the use of standard definitions and classifications, and the maintenance of
						appropriate metadata, including quality attributes of the data. Any quality (or software) issues
						arising from the use of integrated datasets will be addressed by a governance protocol developed
						by data custodians and integrating authorities (see <a
							href="Data_Integration_-_Roles_and_responsibilities_of_data_custodians.html#.284.29_Entering_into_agreements_with_integrating_authorities">Role
							4: Entering into agreements with Integrating Authorities</a>).
					</p>
					<h1><span id="(2)_Assessing_the_level_of_risk_for_each_data_integration_project"></span>(2)
						Assessing the level of risk for each data integration project</h1>
					<p>14. A key role of data custodians is to determine the level of risk for a data integration
						project, using the risk assessment framework developed for Commonwealth data integration
						projects. The level of risk is an important part of determining if a project should proceed and
						whether an accredited Integrating Authority is required to manage the integration project (i.e.
						if the project is assessed as high risk). Where there is more than one data custodian, a lead
						data custodian may be appointed by the data custodians to compile the risk assessments.
					</p>
					<h1><span
							id="(3)_Ensuring_compliance_with_relevant_legislation,_including_privacy,_for_data_release"></span>(3)
						Ensuring compliance with relevant legislation, including privacy, for data release</h1>
					<p>16. Data custodians need to take into account the potential privacy impacts for any given data
						integration project. Guidelines for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information
						by Commonwealth and ACT government agencies are stipulated in Information Privacy Principles
						contained in the Privacy Act 1988. The same legislation also extends to some private sector
						organisations and small businesses (including non-profit organisations or unincorporated
						associations) under National Privacy Principles (Endnote 4).
					</p>
					<p>17. Agency-specific legislation also affects the disclosure of personal information obtained
						through data collections. Examples include secrecy provisions that apply to statistical
						collections under the Census and Statistics Act 1905 (ABS), identifiable data disclosed under
						the Health Insurance Act 1973 and National Health Act 1953 (Department of Health), and the
						disclosure of protected information relating to income support (Social Security (Administration)
						Act 1999) and family payments (A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999)
						(Department of Social Services).
					</p>
					<p>18. For all data integration projects, data custodians must determine whether they are authorised
						to release identifiable data to an integrating authority either by the data custodian’s
						legislation or by consent from the data provider (that is, the person, family, household,
						business or other organisation who originally supplied the data for statistical and
						administrative purposes).
					</p>
					<p>19. The data custodian must be satisfied that the integrating authority has the necessary
						legislative protections in place prohibiting disclosure of identifiable data, other than where
						allowed by law. In particular accredited Integrating Authorities undertaking high risk data
						integration projects must be bound by the Commonwealth Privacy Act (or a state/territory
						equivalent) and be subject to criminal penalties for a breach of legislation with regard to an
						unauthorised disclosure of information. For low and medium risk projects, at a minimum,
						integrating authorities must have an appropriate policy framework in place to ensure that no
						identifiable data is disclosed, other than where allowed by legislation (Endnote 5).
					</p>
					<p>20. A Privacy Impact Assessment should be considered for ‘high risk’ projects. This will help
						data custodians identify and address any potential privacy risks around the collection, use and
						release of data. An example of work undertaken as part of a Privacy Impact Assessment is an
						examination of the public interest test by health data custodians. Under Section 95a of the
						Privacy Act 1988, National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guidelines allow for the
						use and disclosure of health information where it substantially outweighs the public interest in
						maintaining privacy.
					</p>
					<p>21. Where legislative authority does not exist to release data to an integrating authority,
						informed consent must be obtained from data providers before the release of data to an
						integrating authority.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h1><span id="(4)_Entering_into_agreements_with_integrating_authorities"></span>(4) Entering into
						agreements with integrating authorities</h1>
					<p>22. Each data custodian must enter into an agreement with a nominated integrating authority. This
						agreement may take the form of a contract, Memorandum of Understanding or other arrangement as
						appropriate for the parties concerned. When the data custodian and integrating authority is the
						same agency, appropriate internal governance arrangements, rather than an agreement, will need
						to be in place. The purpose of a project agreement is to help ensure that datasets are managed
						and used in accordance with data custodian requirements throughout the life of the project
						(Endnote 6).
					</p>
					<p>23. The terms of the agreement will vary on a project-by-project basis, but will generally
						consist of core elements such as:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Information on how data will be safely managed, including the provision of secure data
							arrangements by integrating authorities, to help manage project risks;</li>
						<li>The use of data protocols that balance risk and public benefit (e.g., the use of ethics
							committees for human-based health research);</li>
						<li>Specifying control mechanisms, in collaboration with integrating authorities, to assess and
							ensure that individual or business data is not likely to be identified. This may take the
							form of data modification or data reduction techniques.</li>
						<li>Developing governance protocols to investigate and resolve software issues, along with any
							anomalies, outliers and data quality issues not previously identified or which arise from
							the creation of new integrated datasets. Given that data custodians have a key role in
							quality assurance, it is expected that the data supplied to integrating authorities will be
							of high quality. The protocol will specify how data custodians will work with integrating
							authorities and data users. Data custodians should always consider intellectual property
							rights when deciding whether they are able to make data available for a particular project
							that would involve using any externally owned software or other technology for transmission
							of data to the integrating authority or allowing the integrating authority to use such
							software.</li>
						<li>Specifying any special conditions which must be adhered to by data users. This may include,
							for example, training requirements and the signing of confidentiality agreements with data
							custodians. It may also include assurances that data users will make valid use of datasets.
							For example, data users may be required to seek clearance from data custodians on the use
							and interpretation of data before publishing research outputs. However, this is not a
							uniform requirement across Commonwealth agencies.</li>
						<li>The use of communication, technology, training and other processes to minimise the risk of
							identification of individuals or businesses.</li>
					</ul>
					<h1><span id="(5)_Safe_transmission_of_data"></span>(5) Safe transmission of data</h1>
					<p>24. A key function of data custodians is to ensure the safe transmission of data to integrating
						authorities. The safe transmission of data should be undertaken in accordance with legislative
						and policy requirements prior to the commencement of data linkage operations, and in accordance
						with project agreements. The Australian Protective Security Policy Framework provides further
						information on the safe transmission of Commonwealth data.
					</p>
					<h1><span id="(6)_Maximising_the_value_of_data_holdings"></span>(6) Maximising the value of data
						holdings</h1>
					<p>25. Data custodians must seek to maximise the value of any administrative datasets that are
						collected and take into account the public benefit which can be derived from statistical and
						research proposals submitted by data users, as per Commonwealth Statistical <a
							href="High_Level_Principles_for_Data_Integration_-_Principles_One_-_Strategic_Resource.html"
							title="High Level Principles for Data Integration - Principles One - Strategic Resource">Principle
							1</a> (treat data as a strategic resource). However, Commonwealth administrative data cannot
						be used for statistical or research purposes if this contravenes legislation or any commitment
						made to data providers regarding the purpose for which their data may be used, or the data is
						commercial in confidence.
					</p>
					<p>26. Cross-Commonwealth data integration projects are particularly useful for informing
						whole-of-government policy perspectives and helping to make the best possible use of data that
						already exists and where possible, minimising respondent burden around data collections. Two
						current examples of such data integration projects are listed below.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) links one study period to the next. It
							also links to administrative databases and aggregate census data as a supplement to
							information collected in the survey. LSAC aims to help improve the understanding of factors
							influencing childhood development and collects information on children’s physical, cognitive
							and emotional development. This will help guide policies and interventions to address issues
							affecting the development and wellbeing of Australian children.</li>
						<li>The Business Longitudinal Database combines small and medium size business characteristics
							(sourced from the ABS) with financial data from the Australian Taxation Office and the
							Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. The project provides a basis for measuring
							the performance over time, as well as key business drivers.</li>
					</ul>
					<h1>Multiple roles of data custodians in data integration projects</h1>
					<p>27. For some data integration projects, it is possible that data custodians may have multiple
						roles where a data custodian may also be the data user (e.g., a Commonwealth agency) and/or the
						integrating authority.
					</p>
					<p>28. When an entity has more than one role, appropriate internal governance and project
						documentation, consistent with the Commonwealth principles and governance arrangements for data
						integration should be in place.
					</p>

					<p>29. Any questions about the roles and responsibilities of data custodians should be emailed to
						statistical.data.integration@nss.gov.au
