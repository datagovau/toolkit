					<h2>Publishing open data</h2>
					<p>A fundamental aspect of open data is that it’s available for re-use with formats and licencing
						that allow others to re-use and remix the data.
						This section will guide you through topics like:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="Publishing_your_data.html#Publishing_open_data" title="Publishing your data">How to
								create datasets</a> from new or existing data</li>
						<li>What <a href="Publishing_your_data.html#Intro_to_metadata"
								title="Publishing your data">metadata</a> is and how you should add it</li>
						<li>What <a href="Publishing_your_data.html#Licensing_your_data"
								title="Publishing your data">licences</a> can be used for open data</li>
						<li>Tools for finding <a href="Publishing_your_data.html#Data_portals"
								title="Publishing your data">published data</a></li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Process to opening a dataset</h3>
					<p>While each organisation’s approach to open data will vary, the first step is to determine the
						classification of the data. If it is unclassified then it is appropriate for public access. If
						it is classified, then you need to consider secure and non-open approaches to sharing the data.
						For a guide to improving your organisation’s open data capability, see the <a
							href="Planning.html#Open_data_self-assessment" title="Planning">open data
							self-assessment</a>.
					</p>
					<p><b>Steps</b>
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li><a href="Publishing_your_data.html#Sourcing_data" title="Publishing your data">Choose data
								sets</a> for release in line with your organisation’s approach and your users’ needs.
						</li>
						<li>Clarify who will be responsible for preparing, releasing and updating the data.</li>
						<li><a href="Publishing_your_data.html#Licensing_your_data" title="Publishing your data">Apply
								an open licence</a> – the APS default is Creative Commons Attribution</li>
						<li><a href="Publishing_your_data.html#Creating_datasets" title="Publishing your data">Make the
								data available</a></li>
						<li><a href="How_to_use_data.gov.au.html" title="How to use data.gov.au">Make the data
								discoverable on or through data.gov.au</a></li>
					</ol>
					<h2>Sourcing data</h2>
					<p>These possible sources of data that your organisation could open should be considered as part of
						a larger process to develop and maintain an open data strategy.
					</p>
					<h3>Data from new projects</h3>
					<p>When commissioning research, collecting data or establishing a new ICT system, adopt information
						management and procurement practices that ensure you have access to associated raw data in an
						open format and the right to publish that data online under an open licence. See <a
							href="Publishing_your_data.html#Licensing_your_data" title="Publishing your data">Licensing
							your data</a> for more information. This is important if a service provider is contracted to
						collect the data or to develop a website or mobile app built on an agency data source. Effective
						information governance (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/information-policy/information-policy-resources/information-policy-agency-resources/principles-on-open-public-sector-information">PSI
							Principle 3</a>) will help you ensure that your agency has access to the raw data that was
						used to create existing publications or apps.
					</p>
					<p>You should also ensure that other people in your organisation are aware that these governance
						processes and practices exist and are followed.
					</p>
					<h3>Releasing unpublished data</h3>
					<p>Consider whether your agency has unpublished data that could be released as open data. This may
						come from public reports, studies and newsletters that have only included processed data with
						select results from internal analysis.
					</p>
					<p>Internal data such as project locations, demographic research and administrative data should also
						be considered for release.
					</p>
					<p>Agencies wishing to convert or release previously unpublished data should first consider
						legislative and policy requirements that may prevent publication or require modification of the
						data before release.
					</p>
					<p>In particular, you should consider obligations under the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) in
						the Privacy Act 1988. Guidance about the Privacy Act is available in the OAIC's <a
							rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/applying-privacy-law/app-guidelines/">APP
							Guidelines</a>. In addition, the OAIC's <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/information-policy/information-policy-resources/information-policy-agency-resources/information-policy-agency-resource-1-de-identification-of-data-and-information">Information
							Policy Agency Resource 1 — De-identification of data and information</a> discusses
						de-identification as a technique that allows agencies to balance privacy and transparency
						objectives when publishing open data.
					</p>
					<h2>Creating datasets</h2>
					<h3>Creating a basic open data set</h3>
					<p>Creating a dataset can be a quick and easy process. At its most basic, a data set is simply a
						structured presentation of data, such as a spreadsheet, with some special features. These
						features can be designed as part of the data set from the beginning, or changed before
						publishing.
					</p>
					<p>An open data set must be:
					</p>
					<h4>Saved in an open format</h4>
					<p>Any type of data can be shared in an open format but sometimes this means transforming the data
						from the original format to a different format. The benefit to agencies in publishing data in an
						open format is it makes it easier for someone else to reuse the data, such as another government
						agency or company. The benefits of open data come often from the ability to analyse and remix
						data alongside other data sets.
					</p>
					<p>The table below rates common file types for their accessibility to users with a range of
						computing systems and access requirements.
					</p>
					<p>For data.gov.au, it should be noted that users can publish any data file type, organisations are 
						encouraged to publish the most machine readable and open format. Data.gov.au automatically generates 
						full API access to tabular and spatial datasets uploaded to data.gov.au (through CKAN and Geoserver) 
						and is investigating similar support for other data types. Agencies should contact the data.gov.au 
						team if they are considering publishing relational databases, realtime data or other data types.
					</p>
					<p>If you are creating data for analysis or machine processing, it is important to note that spatial
						files, CSV and XLS are the only formats that automatically generate visualisations or API access
						for your data set on data.gov.au. CSV/XLS files will need to be structured according to the
						advice on the creating data sets page. Data.gov.au provides mapping services for some geospatial
						data types including KML, and will advise on additional formats as they are supported.

					<h4>Formatted properly for tabular data</h4>
					<p>Any tabular data should be published in a CSV file as well as being included as a report. This
						allows users to analyse the data without having to convert it to an appropriate format. This is
						especially important for reports in formats such as PDF which restrict access to data and limit
						the ability for people to share and remix. PDFs should be made accessible or converted to an
						alternative format whenever possible. Tabular data for publishing should be both:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>raw – presented in the simplest possible format with a single header row – and</li>
						<li>clean – using uniform data formatting (eg. Numerical dates, postcodes in every field) with
							no missing entries, no embedded non-text information, data in every field and as few
							mistakes as possible.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Obtaining raw, clean data can be a challenge if you’re converting an existing file into a file
						for uploading as part of a data set. It’s particularly important to look out for elements like
						merged cells and formulas which can prevent the data from being read.
					</p>
					<p>The examples below show how clean data can be easily compared and combined by a computer, whereas
						the non-clean data would confuse the system. For example, the use of Fem, Female and F could be
						processed as separate genders, and the ‘Copyright of Dept. X’ could cause an error in automatic
						processing of the data

					<h4><span id="Accompanied_by_supportive/contextual_documentation"></span>Accompanied by
						supportive/contextual documentation</h4>
					<p>Supportive documentation, caveats and contextual information should be included in descriptive
						information about the data set. If the information is extensive, it may also be possible to
						upload it as an additional resource to the dataset. <b>Please do not </b>put the data into the
						documentation itself, as it will restrict access to the data. This means the data will become
						less accessible to users, and will not be able to be picked up by APIs, data visualisation tools
						or other machine-to-machine processes.
					</p>
					<h4>Formatted to be useful</h4>
					<p>Data should be published with consideration for how it will be most useful. For example, column
						labels with internal codes like ‘DBQ-12-W’ will be a lot less useful than human-readable labels
						like ‘Drop Bear Queries 2012 Western Site’.
					</p>
					<p>This is also a consideration when publishing data. For example, a data set on ‘procurement
						contract data’ with individual files for each year will make it easier for users to locate
						related data than individual data sets for each year. It will also be easier for data custodians
						to manage and maintain.
					</p>
					<h4>Extra credit</h4>
					<p>As noted in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://webguide.gov.au/">Australian
							Government Web Guide</a>, once the data is ready to publish in an open format, the agency
						should:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>prepare appropriate metadata to accompany the dataset to ensure the data is discoverable and
							meaningful to the public. See <a href="Publishing_your_data.html#Intro_to_metadata"
								title="Publishing your data">intro to metadata</a> for more information.</li>
						<li>publish the data in an appropriate place, such as the agency website, data.gov.au, or an
							existing domain-specific collection or catalogue repository. See the <a
								href="Publishing_your_data.html#Where_to_publish" title="Publishing your data">where to
								publish</a> page and the section on <a
								href="http://toolkit.data.gov.au/index.php?title=Using_data.gov.au&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"
								class="new" title="Using data.gov.au (page does not exist)">using data.gov.au</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>You should also consider how to refine your approach so that the data (or subsequent releases of
						equivalent data) remains relevant and useful in future. This could include engaging with
						stakeholders; assessing how the data was reused; and considering whether the data should be
						presented in a different format or made accessible in different ways, such as through an
						application programming interface or API that allows programmers to easily reuse the data.
					</p>
					<h2>Where to publish</h2>

					<h2>Intro to metadata</h2>
					<h3><span id="What_is_metadata?"></span>What is metadata?</h3>
					<p>Metadata is information about data. It describes the content, format, quality, currency and
						availability of data in a consistent and meaningful way.
					</p>
					<p>Metadata is useful for cataloguing single documents, but is most important for managing a large
						body of data. This is particularly important for open government data, as people who work with
						the data may be combining data sets from a wide range sources, both inside and outside of
						government.
					</p>
					<p>Establishing a common vocabulary for metadata – <a href="Publishing_your_data.html#Standards"
							title="Publishing your data">using standards</a> – makes it possible for users to find and
						remix data in a clear and structured way. As open data infrastructure evolves, detailed metadata
						will not only allow more people to find your data, it will also allow them to re-use the data in
						more meaningful ways.
					</p>
					<h3><span id="How_is_it_used?"></span>How is it used?</h3>
					<p>There are a range of metadata standards that are used based on the data that is being described
						and where it is available. Each metadata standard contains elements, or fields, that describe
						the data. A common example of a metadata element is the ‘Title’, which contains the name of the
						dataset.
					</p>
					<p>The <a href="How_to_use_data.gov.au.html#Metadata" title="How to use data.gov.au">data.gov.au
							metadata</a> section has information on the simple form on data.gov.au that is used to make
						data discoverable through the sites. For people who need technical information, the metadata
						requirements for specific data types such as spatial data are also described there.
					</p>
					<p>Agencies considering the establishment of their own data catalogues should consider the <a

							metadata profile</a>, based on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">DCAT</a>. Spatial data catalogues should use the <a

						(which also maps to the data.gov.au DCAT schema).

					<h2>Licensing your data</h2>
					<p>Licences provide a clear and standardised guide for other people about how they can use your
						data, including the option to reuse, remix and share the content.
					</p>
					<p>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IntellectualProperty/Pages/AustralianGovernmentIPrules.aspx">Statement
							of IP Principles for Australian Government Agencies</a> requires agencies to encourage
						public use and easy access to published material. This includes permission for public use and
						re-use of material without requiring royalties and on a non-exclusive basis.
					</p>
					<p>The default licence for the Australian Government is the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0
						Australia (CC BY 3.0 AU) for publishing data and information, unless a clear case is made for
						another open licence. You can access the licence text on the Creative Commons website in either
						<a rel="nofollow" class="external text"

					<h2>Privacy and security</h2>
					<p>It is important to ensure you approach data publishing with privacy and security principles in
						mind. For more information about privacy and security considerations, please refer to the <a

					</p>
					<h2>Standards</h2>
					<p>Standards are an important aspect of open data, as they ensure data is accessible and
						interoperable. Please see the section on [Data Formats] for information about open data
						standards. Below are some additional standards agencies should consider.
					</p>
					<h3>Implementing standards</h3>
					<p>There are a wide range of standards that may be relevant to data projects, relating to issues
						like spatial information, metadata and addressing. The <a
							href="http://toolkit.data.gov.au/index.php?title=Spatial&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"
							class="new" title="Spatial (page does not exist)">spatial</a> and <a

						pages of this toolkit have more information on how to use their required standards.
					</p>
					<h3>Standards management</h3>
					<p>System owners and data owners should, wherever possible, consider relevant international and
						Australian standards for their data.
					</p>
					<p>Standards bodies dealing with data include:

					<p>This section will be updated as guidance evolves.
					</p>
					<h2>Intro to spatial data</h2>
					<p>Spatial data is any data that refers to places in the physical world. This can include:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Geographic features like mountains and lakes</li>
						<li>Man-made objects like houses and roads</li>
						<li>Non-physical objects or information about the location like electoral boundaries or internet
							quality</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Spatial data sets are fundamentally the same as all other data sets; they simply contain fields
						for spatial information such as latitude and longitude as well as their other information. This
						means all the guides to making data open still apply.
					</p>
					<h3>The Statistical Spatial Framework</h3>

					<h2>NationalMap</h2>
					<h3>What is the NationalMap</h3>
					<p>The NationalMap is a website for map-based access to government spatial data. It is designed to:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Provide easy access to data for government, business and the public</li>
						<li>Integrate datasets into a ‘front end map’ for <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
								href="http://data.gov.au">data.gov.au</a></li>
						<li>Provide an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community
							innovation</li>
						<li>Provide agencies with an easy map to embed on their own websites</li>
					</ul>
					<p><br />

					</p>
					<h3><span id="How_do_you_use_the_data?"></span>How do you use the data?</h3>
					<p>To view a data set on the NationalMap, go to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/">http://nationalmap.gov.au/</a>, select Data then National
						Data Sets. This will display a list of available data topics.
					</p>
					<p>Other tips:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>To zoom to a data set’s area on the map, click on the name of the data set.</li>
						<li>For detail about specific information captured in a data set, click on the specific point,
							line or area on the map.</li>
						<li>For detail about the entire data set, click ‘info’ next to the name of a data set for more
							information, conditions of use and a link to download the data.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>NationalMap is best used with a browser with WebGL support such as the latest versions of Google
						Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer 11. It will work with limited functionality in
						older browsers such as Internet Explorer 9 and Internet Explorer 10.
					</p>
					<p>Possible uses for the NationalMap include:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Finding data sets and services (for any data set or service visible in the NationalMap,
							click "info" to view how to access the data set/service directly).</li>
						<li>Set up a Web Map Service (WMS) or Web Feature Service (WFS) and load the URL for that
							service into NationalMap. For example, you can use the open source software Geoserver to do
							this or use one of many commercial GIS systems such as ESRI ArcGIS Server, Pitney Bowes'
							Mapinfo or Google Maps Engine and enable WMS and/or WFS services from it.</li>
						<li>Build a website that uses the value-add service API. Email <a rel="nofollow"
								class="external text"
								href="mailto:nationalmap@lists.csiro.au">nationalmap@lists.csiro.au</a> to find out how.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3><span id="How_do_you_add_data?"></span>How do you add data?</h3>
					<p>Government data can be added to the NationalMap by uploading it to <a rel="nofollow"
							class="external text" href="http://data.gov.au">data.gov.au</a> in a common spatial data
						format. The main data formats supported by the NationalMap are GeoJSON, KML, KMZ and CSV (with
						latitude and longitude columns). The NationalMap routinely harvests spatial services from <a
							rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://data.gov.au">data.gov.au</a> and FIND. It
						takes between 24 - 48 hours from when a spatial data set is uploaded to <a rel="nofollow"
							class="external text" href="http://data.gov.au">data.gov.au</a> for it to appear on the
						NationalMap.
					</p>
					<p>If uploaded spatial data to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://data.gov.au">data.gov.au</a> is not showing on NationalMap, start by checking
						the data is in one of the formats listed above. If the issues is not resolved, email <a
							rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="mailto:spatial@pmc.gov.au">spatial@pmc.gov.au</a>.
					</p>
					<p>A data set can be added to NationalMap for a single session by dragging it on to the map or
						clicking on ‘Add Data’ under the Data tab. This is particularly relevant when working with
						personal, private or temporary data that cannot be uploaded to <a rel="nofollow"
							class="external text" href="http://data.gov.au">data.gov.au</a>. Data added to a map in this
						way will not be saved on the NationalMap and cannot be shared using the share button on the
						site.
					</p>
					<p>For large data sets that are better streamed than uploaded, email <a rel="nofollow"
							class="external text"
							href="mailto:nationalmap@lists.csiro.au">nationalmap@lists.csiro.au</a> to discuss options
						for making data available in more detail.
					</p>
					<h3><span id="How_does_the_NationalMap_work?"></span>How does the NationalMap work?</h3>
					<p>The NationalMap is a fully open architecture that provides a direct link between the user and the
						government department or agency who is the custodian of the data. For example, if you access
						data relating to "broadband availability and quality", you are accessing that directly from the
						Department of Communications and the Arts; when you access data relating to surface geology, it
						is accessed directly from Geoscience Australia. The NationalMap itself does not store any data -
						it provides a map-based view to data that is stored by a growing number of government bodies.
					</p>
					<h3>Open source software</h3>
					<p>The NationalMap was created with the following open source software. The developers contribute
						back to the software projects as appropriate.
