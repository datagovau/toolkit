					<h2>What is Open Data</h2>
					<p>Put briefly, open data is data that is freely-available, easily-discoverable, accessible and
						published in ways and under licences that allow reuse. Open data may be available in other forms
						that do not meet those standards. For example, data published in a PDF file with all rights
						reserved is less open than data in a spread sheet file published under a Creative Commons BY
						licence. See below data.gov.au for more advice about open data.
					</p>
					<p>All Commonwealth Government data should be hosted on or linked through data.gov.au as the
						authoritative point of discovery for Commonwealth data.
					</p>
					<h3><span
							id="Assess_upcoming_agency_publications,_websites,_mobile_apps_and_other_agency_information_resources_to_identify_datasets_suitable_for_release_as_open_data"></span>Assess
						upcoming agency publications, websites, mobile apps and other agency information resources to
						identify datasets suitable for release as open data</h3>
					<p>Consider whether upcoming publications contain information that is suitable for release in an
						open data format. Many government reports include agency data about financial, economic, social
						or regulatory activity or trends, or present data in formats unsuited to reuse (such as
						publishing tabular data in a PDF file rather than a reusable spread sheet format). Often the
						underlying raw data could be released alongside the report in a reusable open data format.
					</p>
					<p>For example, as part of the budget process the Government now publishes <a rel="nofollow"
							class="external text"
							href="http://data.gov.au/dataset/budget-2014-15-tables-and-data">financial data from the
							portfolio budget statements</a> in a reusable format on data.gov.au in addition to the
						statements themselves which are available on departmental websites.
					</p>
					<p>This approach can also work for agency websites and mobile apps that present information to the
						public. For example, the Department of Human Services’ (DHS) <a rel="nofollow"
							class="external text" href="http://humanservices.findnearest.com.au/">Service Locator
							tool</a> allows people to find their nearest Centrelink, Medicare or Child Support location.
						DHS released the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://data.gov.au/organization/departmentofhumanservices">raw Service Locator
							geospatial data</a> on data.gov.au. This makes the data available to the public to build
						their own apps using the data. Another example is the Department of Finance’s release of <a
							rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://data.gov.au/dataset/historical-australian-government-contract-data">historical
							government contract data</a> from the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://www.tenders.gov.au/?event=public.reports.listCNWeeklyExport">AusTender
							website</a> on data.gov.au.
					</p>
					<p>Agencies can also assess whether any material they have already published online in publications,
						websites or apps is suitable for release as open data. This could include material published as
						part of the FOI Act Information Publication Scheme or in an agency disclosure log.
					</p>
					<h3>Ensure you will have access to the raw data and the right to publish it</h3>
					<p>Effective information governance (PSI Principle 3) will help you ensure that your agency has
						access to the raw data that was used to create existing publications or apps.
					</p>
					<p>When commissioning research, collecting data or establishing a new ICT system, adopt information
						management and procurement practices that ensure you have access to associated raw data in an
						open format and the right to publish that data online under an open licence. This is important
						if a service provider is contracted to collect the data or to develop a website or mobile app
						built on an agency data source.
					</p>
					<h3><span id="Prepare,_publish_and_refine"></span>Prepare, publish and refine</h3>
					<p>As noted in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://webguide.gov.au/">Australian
							Government Web Guide</a>, once the data is ready to publish in an open format, the agency
						should:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>prepare appropriate metadata to accompany the dataset, to ensure the data is discoverable
							and meaningful to the public</li>
						<li>publish the data in an appropriate place, such as the agency website, data.gov.au, or an
							existing domain-specific collection or catalogue repository.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>You should also consider how to refine your approach so that the data (or subsequent releases of
						equivalent data) remains relevant and useful in future. This could include engaging with
						stakeholders, assessing how the data was reused and considering whether the data should be
						presented in a different format or made accessible in different ways (for example, through an
						application programming interface or API that allows programmers to easily reuse the data).
					</p>
					<h3>Next steps: releasing unpublished data</h3>
					<p>Consider whether your agency has unpublished data that could be released as open data.
					</p>
					<p>Agencies wishing to convert or release previously unpublished data should first consider
						legislative and policy requirements that may prevent publication or require modification of the
						data before release.
					</p>
					<p>In particular, you should consider obligations under the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) in
						the Privacy Act 1988. Guidance about the Privacy Act is available in the OAIC's <a
							rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/applying-privacy-law/app-guidelines/">APP
							Guidelines</a>. In addition, the OAIC's <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/information-policy/information-policy-resources/information-policy-agency-resources/information-policy-agency-resource-1-de-identification-of-data-and-information">Information
							Policy Agency Resource 1 — De-identification of data and information</a> discusses
						de-identification as a technique that allows agencies to balance privacy and transparency
						objectives when publishing open data.
					</p>
					<p>The information provided in this resource is of a general nature. It is not a substitute for
						legal advice.
					</p>
					<h2>Licensing</h2>
					<p>The Australian Government policy on publishing data and information is <a rel="nofollow"
							class="external text" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/">Creative Commons
							Attribution 3.0 Australia (CC BY 3.0 AU)</a> as the default. This is stated at point 11(b)
						in the mandatory <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
								href="http://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IntellectualProperty/Pages/AustralianGovernmentIPrules.aspx">Statement
								of IP Principles for Australian Government Agencies</a></i>.
					</p>
					<p>Agencies are advised that processed data or data in aggregate does not inherit the source data
						licensing or ownership because it is a new dataset and can be licensed however the agency wants,
						preferable CC-BY as per the default Commonwealth position above.
					</p>
					<h2><span id="Standards,_Specifications_and_Formats"></span>Standards, Specifications and Formats
					</h2>
					<p>Standards and specifications developed in processes with the attributes identified above enable
						data, products, and services to be used by anyone, at any time, and spur innovation and growth.
						Agencies should prioritise the use of open data formats that are non-proprietary, publicly
						available, and place no restrictions upon its use. Use of standards, specifications and formats
						can provide significant benefits to agencies and stakeholders while helping to implement open
						data priorities. See the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="https://theodi.org.au/standards/#open-formats">ODI website for some useful examples of
							open formats</a>.
					</p>
					<h3>Best Practices for Data Standards</h3>
					<p>System owners and data owners should, wherever possible, consider relevant international and
						Australian standards for data elements. Standards bodies dealing with data include:
					</p>
					<p>International Standards
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
								href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_ics">International Organization for
								Standardization</a> (ISO)</li>
						<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards">Open
								Geospatial Consortium</a> (OGC)</li>
						<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.standards.org.au/">Standards
								Australia</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Australian Government Standards that have been adopted for use:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.agls.gov.au/">AGLS</a> (National
							Archives)</li>

							Profile</li>
						<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
								href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1407.0.55.002main+features22013">SDMX</a>

						<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
								href="http://www.aixm.aero/public/subsite_homepage/homepage.html">AIXM</a> (Aeronautical
							Information Exchange Model standard)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This section will be updated as guidance evolves.
					</p>
					<h2>Common Core Metadata</h2>
					<p>This section contains guidance to support the use of the common core metadata to list agency
						datasets and application programming interfaces (APIs) as hosted at data.gov.au and the
						geospatial data held on FIND.ga.gov.au.
					</p>
					<p>Metadata is information about data. It describes the content, format, quality, currency and
						availability of data in a structured machine readable way. Establishing a common vocabulary for
						the metadata allows for the management of data in a well defined, structured way. As we evolve
						our infrastructure, detailed metadata will not only allow more people to find your data, it will
						also allow maximum use.
					</p>
					<h3><span id="“Common_Core”_Required_Fields_for_data.gov.au"></span>“Common Core” Required Fields
						for data.gov.au</h3>
					<p>The core discovery metadata for data.gov.au is maintained at <a rel="nofollow"
							class="external free"
							href="http://data.gov.au/dataset/data-gov-au-metadata-and-other-schemas">http://data.gov.au/dataset/data-gov-au-metadata-and-other-schemas</a>
						and was recently updated with extensive stakeholder and experts engagement to align with
						international best practices <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">DCAT</a> whilst mapping to important local standards
						including AGLS, ANZLIC, ISO19115 and AGIFT.
					</p>
					<h3>Common Core Metadata Schema for FIND.ga.gov.au</h3>
					<p>Creating and maintaining quality metadata is a significant organisational commitment; however, it
						should not be seen as a major burden on resources or business processes. Organisations that
						conform to the ANZLIC Metadata Profile should find that the creation and maintenance of metadata
						becomes an integral and seamless component of their business processes.
					</p>
					<p>The ANZLIC Metadata Profile will facilitate efficient access to descriptions of information
						resources, and in particular geographic (or spatial) data. Adoption of, and compliance with, the
						ANZLIC Metadata Profile will ensure a consistent approach to spatial information resources
						throughout Australia and New Zealand. This will help people and applications to locate resources
						without detailed knowledge of the data or resources being sought or an understanding of complex
						jurisdictional or organisational structures.
					</p>
					<p>The use of standardised descriptions will enable online search engines to process queries more
						efficiently. This helps to ensure that people and applications conducting searches are presented
						with relevant and meaningful results. Custodians of geospatial data assets will benefit as their
						information resources become discoverable by a much wider range of potential users, at
						negligible cost, than could ordinarily be found through traditional marketing and distribution
						channels.
					</p>
					<p>Please download the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="/images/5/57/FIND-coreMetadata-ANZLIC-profile-20140903.csv">‎FIND metadata profile</a>
						noting M: Mandatory, C: Conditional (on if you select another element), O: Optional in the
						standard but recommended as good practise.
					</p>
					<p>See the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://anzlic.gov.au">ANZLIC profile
							document and guidance</a> or contact spatial@communications.gov.au for more information or
						assistance on best practice implementation.

					<h2>Types of data</h2>
					<p>Below is a diagram that nicely articulates the difference and commonalities of open, big and
						government data. Published with permission from author Joel Gurin:

					</p>
					<h3>Tabular Data</h3>
					<p>Much data held by agencies is tabular in nature. That is, tables or spreadsheets. Machine
						readable tabular data published on data.gov.au automatically generates an API that can be used
						by developers.
					</p>
					<h3>Spatial Data</h3>
					<p>The Department of Communications is the Commonwealth Government policy authority for spatial data
						and you can find information about spatial policy and practice at <a rel="nofollow"
							class="external free" href="http://spatial.gov.au/">http://spatial.gov.au/</a>. We will add
						more content here in the near future, but please see the work on the <a rel="nofollow"
							class="external text"
							href="http://spatial.gov.au/anzlic/anz-foundation-spatial-data-framework">ANZ Foundation
							Spatial Data Framework (FSDF)</a> for major spatial data work happening across the
						Commonwealth.
					</p>
					<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://find.ga.gov.au">FIND</a> is the national
						spatial directory, listing government, research and private sector spatial datasets. Spatial
						data hosted on data.gov.au automatically generates appropriate spatial web services
						(WFS/WMS/etc) also automatically shows up on FIND.
					</p>
					<p>Agencies can also find useful guidance on geocoding on the <a rel="nofollow"
							class="external text"
							href="http://www.nss.gov.au/nss/home.NSF/pages/Statistical%20Spatial%20Framework">Statistical
							Spatial Framework Home Page</a>.
					</p>
					<h3>Big Data</h3>
					<p>The Department of Finance is the Commonwealth Government policy authority for big data. Below are
						a few useful big data resources:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.finance.gov.au/big-data/">The
								Australian Public Service Big Data Strategy</a></li>

						<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.finance.gov.au/node/34900/">Draft
								Guide to Responsible Data Analytics</a> (Appendix to the Better Practice Guide)</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Aggregated Data</h3>
					<p>Aggregated or other types of processed data does not tend to have the same privacy issues as unit
						record level data. Unfortunately however, agencies use myriad ways to aggregate data which is
						not always comparable. Agencies are encouraged to use the most appropriately granular level from
						the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/Australian+Statistical+Geography+Standard+(ASGS)">Australian
							Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS)</a> such as mesh or SA1 blocks to publish aggregate
						data as this makes aggregate data comparable over time and across agencies. If agencies use
						postcodes or electorates to publish data, it is difficult to compare the data over time as these
						administrative boundaries change regularly.
					</p>
					<p>Agencies are encouraged to review the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://www.nss.gov.au/nss/home.NSF/pages/Confidentiality+Information+Sheets">Confidentiality
							Information Series</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://www.nss.gov.au/nss/home.NSF/533222ebfd5ac03aca25711000044c9e/1f951c3977938593ca257ab500090a08/$FILE/SSF">Guidance_Geographic
							Differencing_1.pdf Protecting Privacy for Geospatially Enabled Statistics</a> guidance
						provided by the National Statistical Service for good general information and further links to
						more detailed information relating to both aggregate and unit record data, including specific
						issues around data for regions.
					</p>
					<p>Further guidance on this will be made available in late 2014.
					</p>
					<h3>Unit Record and Integrated Data</h3>
					<p>Unit record data is generally the most granular level of data an agency has to deal with as it
						generally means the individual records in a dataset. Often it is very difficult to make this
						data publicly available in its raw state, even with unique identifies, as it can be possible to
						re-identify individuals if not careful. There are a few ways agencies can go about dealing such
						data:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>With anonymisation on the fly APIs, such as is the case with the ABS data through <a
								rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://stat.abs.gov.au/">ABS.Stat</a>.
							Agencies are encouraged to speak to the ABS about this approach to share expertise.</li>
						<li>Agencies can publish the data in aggregate - see above. Agencies are encouraged to publish
							aggregate data according to the ASGS administrative mesh or SA1 blocks.</li>
						<li>Sometimes unit record data can be sufficiently deidentified to publish in bulk, but this
							depends strongly on the data. Agencies are encouraged to seek advice from Finance,
							Communications or the Privacy Commissioner.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Government Entities are encouraged to use the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://statistical-data-integration.govspace.gov.au/">Guide for Data Integration
							Projects Involving Commonwealth Data for Statistical and Research Purposes</a> for
						integrated data purposes. It includes principles, guidance, how to become an "Integrating
						Authority" and appropriate approaches to data integration projects. The Guide has the stated
						goal of "Creating a safe and effective environment for data integration: an Australian
						Government approach to facilitate linkage of social, economic and environmental data for
						statistical and research purposes".
					</p>
					<p>The National Statistical Service has also developer <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
							href="http://www.nss.gov.au/nss/home.nsf/pages/Data%20integration%20-%20data%20linking%20information%20series">resources
							on data linking</a>.
					</p>
					<p>It is also worth noting that it is generally researchers (both internal and external) who need
						access to such data in this format. Researchers generally already have the ethical, legal,
						technical and other appropriate frameworks and mechanisms to access this data, though there are
						significant challenges for researchers in accessing and analysing data across government(s).
						Lowering the granularity of data reduces the privacy issues but also reduces the value to
						researchers. There is currently some work underway to identify issues and improve researcher
						access to data.
					</p>
					<p>A useful case study for enabling research access is the ABS <a rel="nofollow"
							class="external text"
							href="http://abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/CURF:+Remote+Access+Data+Laboratory+(RADL)">Remote
							Access Data Laboratory (RADL)</a>.
					</p>
					<p>Unit record data that is published in raw form can be reidentified given enough data points for
						an individual record. For example:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external free"
								href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/09/your-secrets-live-online-in-databases-of-ruin/">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/09/your-secrets-live-online-in-databases-of-ruin/</a>;
							and,</li>
						<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external free"
								href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/27/new-york-taxi-details-anonymised-data-researchers-warn">http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/27/new-york-taxi-details-anonymised-data-researchers-warn</a>.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>The Business Case for Open Data</h2>
					<p>The three core benefit and value areas of opening government data are generally seen as:
					</p>
					<dl>
						<dd>
							<ol>
								<li>social and economic public benefits and opportunities.</li>
								<li>more efficient and effective government; and,</li>
								<li>transparency &amp; accountability;</li>
							</ol>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<p>These aspects are given varying prioritisation in different government jurisdictions around the
						world and even within Australia. In Australia the focus of open data as a public good is well
						understood but difficult to sustain in an environment of increasingly shrinking resources and
						funding. The application of data for improving the public service however, is becoming better
						understood. Articulating the benefits to the public service in opening up data is a vital part
						in encouraging Agencies to develop sustainable data publishing strategies. Benefits include
						productivity gains, cutting red tape through more efficient practices and data
						collection/management, more effective online/mobile service delivery, improved policy
						development, cost savings through common data access across whole of government and improved
						application of data for better spending decision-making and whole of government strategic
						development, etc.
					</p>
					<p>The Australian Government holds a large amount of data but does not currently used it to best
						effect. Some agencies collect large amounts of data in the natural course of their operations,
						and tend to focus more on collection rather than analysis or broader utility. Some hold ‘single
						sources of truth’ fundamental to the operation of government. Others have developed a number of
						data initiatives in isolation which have provided key insights to a small number of people.
						Agencies’ efforts are rarely connected, sometimes duplicative, and of variable quality with
						inconsistent standards. The value of such initiatives to the whole of government is rarely
						articulated or realised.
					</p>
					<p>Better use of available data can identify problems, improve decisions, strengthen policy-making
						and support more efficient, effective and sustainable program. Exposing quality data to business
						and the community can assist accountability, transparency and innovation.
					</p>
					<p>Given the wide variety of data sources, level of capability and capacity within government, the
						constraints currently limiting agencies in their use of data, and the lack of a mandate or
						imperative on Agencies to publish, the challenge seems considerable. But the Government cannot
						afford not to improve its use of data. Finance’s own experience running one of the key single
						source of truth—the Budget forecast and actuals — its collection and management of data for a
						number of whole of government programs it administers, and the carriage of data.gov.au
						demonstrates that where data is analysed from a whole of government perspective, it improves
						knowledge of products and services, industry, decision-making and outcomes and overall
						productivity of government.

						building block to improve government services and policy, facilitate private and public sector
						innovation, and stimulate economic development.
