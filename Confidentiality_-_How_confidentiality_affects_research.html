					</p>
					<p><br />
						Confidentialisation techniques are applied to microdata (unit record data where each record
						represents observations for a person or organisation) to enable them to be made available to
						analysts and researchers. Without these techniques, access to valuable information for research
						and analytic purposes would be severely restricted. Although application of confidentialisation
						techniques generally leads to losses in information availability, when confidentialisation is
						done well and with knowledge of the key research objectives in mind, the information loss can be
						minimal. This fact sheet looks at the impact of confidentialisation on information availability
						for use in research and analysis.
					</p>
					<p>There has always been a debate over the delicate balance between gaining full, unrestricted
						access to data (for researchers), and the application of confidentiality techniques to protect
						the privacy of data providers (by data custodians). Selecting the confidentiality techniques to
						be applied to microdata is a careful balance between fulfilling obligations to protect the
						identity of individuals and organisations and maximising the information available for
						statistical and research purposes.
					</p>
					<p>The information required by the research sector is becoming more sophisticated over time.
						Increases in the use of techniques such as data linkage, data modelling, and data mining mean
						that researchers’ requirements are more detailed and more varied than ever before. As a
						consequence, there is more pressure on data custodians to provide greater access to microdata
						through high quality, detailed unit record files.
					</p>
					<p>Users of microdata may be concerned that any reductions or changes made to datasets during the
						confidentialisation process may affect their ability to undertake analysis or research using the
						data, or may impact on the results of an analysis. However, generally very few changes need to
						be made to the dataset, and in most cases these have no impact on statistical analyses.
					</p>
					<p>The goal of confidentialisation is to protect the identity of individual respondents. The main
						types of data cells affected when confidentialising a dataset are:
					</p>
					<p>- rare events or characteristics;
						- unusual data (extreme high or low reported values); and
						- low count cross-classification cells.
					</p>
					<p>Generally, statistical analysis is based on observing trends and patterns in data, and most
						statistical techniques rely on multiple events or individuals with similar characteristics from
						which to draw inferences. Where there are multiple observations with similar characteristics,
						the risk of individual identification is low, and the confidentialisation process generally
						would not result in any change to the data. The low frequency events and unusual values that are
						targeted in confidentialisation procedures are generally not amenable to statistical analysis.

					</p>
					<h1>Types of research</h1>
					<p>While the data requirements for researchers are highly diverse, research studies can be broadly
						divided into two main groups - quantitative and non-quantitative. Quantitative studies require
						sufficient amounts of data for reliable estimates or models; non-quantitative studies may focus
						on an in-depth analysis of an unusual characteristic or small cohort.
						Back to top
					</p>
					<h1>Quantitative research and confidentiality</h1>
					<p>When undertaking analysis for quantitative based research, analysts require sufficient amounts of
						data to ensure high quality outputs. If the required variables of interest are available,
						Confidentialised Unit Record Files (CURFs) should be able to meet the needs of researchers. This
						is because the confidentiality techniques applied to these files are the same steps that
						analysts typically apply to the data to ensure robust outputs. That is:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>collapse cells with small counts;</li>
						<li>collapse numeric values into groups;</li>
						<li>recode variables with long tails (extreme high or low reported values); and</li>
						<li>remove, or otherwise treat, outliers in distributions.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>For these types of analyses the outputs achieved using CURFs should not differ greatly from the
						results that would have been achieved using the original non-confidentialised unit record files.
					</p>

					<h1><span id="Example:_How_does_confidentiality_affect_statistical_analysis?"></span>Example: How
						does confidentiality affect statistical analysis?</h1>
					<p>Professor David Lawrence, Telethon Institute of Child Health Research (TICHR)
					</p>
					<h2>Case study: Cigarette smoking and anxiety disorders</h2>
					<p>TICHR conducted a study using the ABS’ 2007 Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing expanded
						Confidentialised Unit Record File (CURF) to investigate the association between smoking and
						mental health problems. The expanded CURF was analysed through the Remote Access Data Laboratory
						(RADL). The RADL is a remote analysis environment where a client can submit analysis code to the
						data custodian, via the internet, and subsequently receive the output without ever having direct
						access to the unit record level information.
					</p>
					<p>After the project was completed, an evaluation was conducted to determine whether the
						confidentiality techniques of perturbation and re-coding of variables (high and low data values)
						applied to the CURF had any effect on the results of the analysis. An ABS officer re-ran the
						analyses using the Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing master file (the original file before
						confidentialisation techniques were applied). The analysis included running several multi-way
						weighted tables of proportions, and fitting several logistic and proportional hazards regression
						models. Results from the study were published to three significant digits. None of the figures
						varied between the CURF and master file analyses at this level of precision.
					</p>
					<p>Table 1 shows estimated hazard ratios for quitting smoking to five significant digits as obtained
						from performing the same analyses on both the expanded CURF and the original master file. The
						largest difference was observed at the level of 4 significant digits, and represented 1% of the
						standard error of the relevant estimate.
					</p>
					<p>The minor changes between the CURF and master file analyses were of neither practical or
						statistical significance. This result is consistent with the very small level of change to the
						dataset during the confidentialisation process as described in the User’s Guide for the survey
						CURF.
					</p>
					<p><b>Summary:</b> When our research on smoking and mental illness was run on the master file, the
						outputs were not practically different to those achieved using the expanded CURF. Therefore, the
						confidentiality techniques applied to the master file (perturbation and recoding of variables)
						did not affect the analyses conducted or the conclusions drawn from them during the project.
					</p>

					<h1>Non-quantitative research</h1>
					<p>Non-quantitative research may include the qualitative investigation of the circumstances
						surrounding rare events of interest. CURFs do not meet the data requirements for these studies
						as CURFs are de-identified and subject to confidentialisation techniques. Alternative approaches
						are needed. This may require the consent of the subjects involved to participate in this type of
						research.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Example: A qualitative study of children born with a rare birth defect</h2>
					<p>This type of study may aim to better understand what factors may have led to the occurrence of a
						rare birth defect, with the ultimate goal of preventing their occurrence or decreasing their
						incidence. Clearly these studies play an important role in understanding rare cases or
						phenomena, but they require an alternative approach to statistical analysis methods. In this
						example, administrative microdata may be useful to identify potential participants in a more
						detailed study. The researcher would require special approval from the custodian to obtain the
						sensitive data records. This permission could be granted by a body such as a Human Research
						Ethics Committee constituted under the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).
						Further to this, permission and further information may be needed from the parents of the child
						born with the rare birth defect. This type of research is best conducted by approaching the
						affected individuals and directly seeking their consent to participate in a research study.
						Statistical analysis of a microdata file, whether from a survey or an administrative data
						source, is rarely the most appropriate research design for this type of investigation.
					</p>
					<h1>Conclusion</h1>
					<p>There are generally two types of research: quantitative and non-quantitative. For quantitative
						research, data custodians are turning to a diverse range of products to meet researchers’ needs,
						including CURFs and data laboratories. Generally speaking, as the small changes that are made to
						unit record files during the confidentialisation process usually target unusual or extreme
						values only, the confidentiality techniques used to make the microdata available have little
						impact on the analyses performed in these types of studies. In many cases the small proportion
						of information that is lost from the original microdata has no impact on the question being
						analysed, and often similar steps would be taken by the researcher to prepare the data for the
						statistical analysis. As a result there will be little to no impact on the analysis using the
						confidentialised file compared to the original file.
					</p>
					<p>For non-quantitative studies, such as examining unusual characteristics or small cohorts, or
						linking datasets, the current publicly available data products or methods are not able to meet
						the researcher’s needs. In these cases, researchers are required to complete a more rigorous
						application process. This may include sign-off from an ethics committee, permission from the
						data custodian, and possibly, permission from the data provider.
					</p>
					<p>These types of data requests are increasing and researchers and data custodians will need to work
						together to come up with innovative ways to streamline access to datasets while ensuring that
						the confidentiality of the data provider is always respected and maintained. This is critical to
						ensuring the continuation of Australia’s high quality data collections.
