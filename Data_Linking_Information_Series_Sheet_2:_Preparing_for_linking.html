					</p>
					<p>Significant effort is required to prepare datasets before they can be linked. Pre-linking
						preparation includes understanding the source dataset, selecting which fields to use for
						linking, data cleaning and standardising and, where required, secure data transfer.
					</p>
					<p>It has been estimated that about three-quarters of the effort involved in data linking involves
						preparing the data to ensure the input files are ready for linking (Gill, 2001).
					</p>
					<p>It is necessary to invest the time and effort in data preparation in order to ensure the quality
						of the linked dataset.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h1>Understanding the source datasets</h1>
					<p>Before attempting linking, it is important to understand the information in the datasets being
						linked, to ensure the linking software is comparing ‘apples with apples’. This can be achieved
						in a number of ways, including examining the metadata and checking a sample of the dataset.
					</p>
					<p>Metadata is information about data that provides context or additional information, such as how
						and when the data was collected, its purpose and quality.
					</p>
					<p>Understanding the metadata helps to avoid combining data that is not compatible. For example, one
						data source might report earnings on a financial year basis while the other uses calendar year
						reporting. This would need to be resolved before linking and analysis can occur.
					</p>
					<p>For more information on metadata, there are references listed at the end of this sheet.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h1>Selecting which fields to use for linking</h1>
					<p>The main requirement when selecting which fields to use for linking is to ensure that they exist
						on each of the datasets being linked. Other considerations include the quality of that data,
						such as whether the data contains any errors or missing information. These may be caused by, for
						example, variations in spelling (Smith and Smyth), incomplete information or spelling errors
						(e.g., is ‘Ray’s Burgers’ the same business as ‘Roy’s Burgers’?).
					</p>
					<p>Differences in the fields on different datasets often arise as a result of factors in the data
						collection phase. Errors may occur if information is supplied by a relative rather than the
						person themselves, as could be the case, for example, for schools enrolment data or hospital
						admissions.
					</p>
					<p>Varying levels of quality between datasets often depend on the relative importance of a
						particular field for a dataset. For example, in mortality datasets the names are critical for
						identity resolution reasons and so this field is collected and transcribed very carefully and
						is, therefore, high quality.
					</p>
					<p><br />
					</p>
					<h1>Data cleaning and standardising</h1>
					<p>The terms ‘data cleaning’ and ‘data standardisation’ refer to the task of transforming the
						records on each dataset into a format that allows them to be linked with other datasets.
					</p>
					<p>The key aim of data cleaning and standardising is to ensure all the data being linked is
						consistent and uniform, so the linking software can work effectively.
					</p>
					<p>Most datasets contain some incomplete, out-of-date or differently formatted information.
						Computerised records can contain errors because, for example, information has been provided or
						recorded incorrectly.
					</p>
					<p>The most common data inconsistencies involve variations in spelling of names, such as nicknames
						(e.g., Rob and Robert), formats of date of birth, data coding and missing information.
						Techniques used to resolve these inconsistencies to convert data into standard forms include:
						editing, standardising, de-duplication and correspondences.
					</p>
					<p><b>Editing</b> is the identification and treatment of data errors and anomalies. For example,
						editing may include the removal of an impossible response, such as a birth date in the future
						and its re-clarification as a missing value.
					</p>
					<p>Where data is missing, sometimes there is enough information available to approximate the data.
						This is often called ‘data repair’. Data repair should be well documented in terms of the
						decisions arrived at and data used to make the repairs.
					</p>
					<p>This may involve accessing additional information from previous data collections similar to the
						one being linked, to check for inconsistencies and help to inform decisions about missing
						information. An example of data repair would involve changing a postcode to match suburb and
						street information.
					</p>
					<p><b>Standardising</b> is the formatting of data items so they are consistently represented in all
						of the datasets. For example, dates can be represented in different formats such as, DD/MM/YYYY
						or MM/DD/YYYY. One format should be selected and employed across all of the datasets for that
						project.
					</p>
					<p><b>De-duplication</b> is removing duplicates from a dataset. For example, when a record
						incorrectly appears more than once in a dataset with exactly the same data item value, one copy
						should be retained, and the others should be removed. Alternatively, the same unit may appear
						more than once in the same dataset but with different values for some of the data items. Sorting
						and ordering the datasets will highlight these cases. A set of rules should be developed to
						treat such duplicates in a consistent manner, such as how to decide which records to keep.
					</p>
					<p><b>Correspondence</b> involves creating a consistent coding classification across all datasets. A
						sound understanding of the data is required to produce the best correspondence. Table 1 shows
						how marital status could be coded in two different datasets.
					</p>
					<p>Dataset 2 could be used as the standard and the first dataset would be altered to be consistent
						with that coding.
					</p>

					<h1>Secure data transfer</h1>
					<p>When transferring data between organisations, secure data transfer considerations are essential
						to preserve privacy. They include consideration of the format, method and encryption.
					</p>
					<p>Box 1 shows an example of secure data transfer, based on Statistics New Zealand’s key steps in
						encrypted-DVD courier delivery – a common method of data transfer for large datasets.
					</p>
					<p>Email transfer is often only suitable for small datasets. More secure email systems are being
						developed that could provide better options for consideration in the future.
					</p>
