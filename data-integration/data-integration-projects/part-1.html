Confidentialisation requires two key steps: </p><ol><li>de-identification of the data, that is, the removal of any direct identifiers (e.g. name and address) from the data; and</li><li>assessment and management of the risk of indirect identification occurring in the de-identified dataset.</li></ol><p>De-identified data does not necessarily protect the identity of individuals or organisations. </p><p>Removing identifying information such as name and address protects data providers from <strong>direct identification</strong>. </p><p>However, it may still be possible to <strong>indirectly identify</strong> a person or an organisation in a de-identified dataset. If enough detail is available, the identity of a particular person or organisation may be derived from the presence of a very rare characteristic or the combination of unique or remarkable characteristics. </p><p>Example: the identity of a person could be deduced if a dataset indicates the person is over 85 years old, has yearly income of more than one million dollars, and resides in a town of 400 people. </p><p>Example: the identity of a person with a very rare disease or health condition could be deduced even in highly aggregated data. </p><p>To protect the identity of individuals and organisations, both direct and indirect identification need to be considered.</p><p>Confidentialising data involves removing or altering information, or collapsing detail, to ensure that no person or organisation is likely to be identified in the data (either directly or indirectly). </p><p>There are various methods used to confidentialise data. These methods aim to protect the identity of individuals and organisations while enabling sufficiently detailed information to be released to make the data useful for statistical and research purposes. </p><p>The main techniques for confidentialising data are described in below: "How to confidentialise data: the basic principles".</p><p>For more information about assessing and managing the risks of indirect identification in microdata see below: "Managing the risk of disclosure in the release of microdata".</p></div><div><h3 id="the-confidentiality-information-series">The confidentiality information series</h3><p>This information sheet is part of a series designed to explain, and provide advice on, a range of issues around confidentialising data. The other sheets are below.</p><div><label class="image-toggle">The obligation to protect identity and privacy<input type="checkbox"><div><p></p><div><p> Confidentiality refers to the obligation of data custodians (agencies that collect information) to keep the confidential information they are entrusted with secret. </p><p>This obligation is recognised in the Privacy Act 1988. The obligation to protect confidential information is also reflected in legislation governing the collection, use and dissemination of information for specific government activities. Examples include the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, the Taxation Administration Act 1953, and the Census and Statistics Act 1905 (see examples below). Penalties apply if the secrecy provisions set out in these Acts are breached. </p><p>As well as the requirements set out in legislation, obligations to protect a person’s or organisation’s identity and privacy are also outlined in government policies and principles. These provide advice on the protocols and procedures required to manage information safely. ‘High Level Principles for Data Integration Involving Commonwealth Data for Statistical and Research Purposes’ is one example of a set of principle-based obligations for Commonwealth government agencies. </p></div></div></label></div><div><label class="image-toggle">Managing identification risks<input type="checkbox"><div><p></p><div><p>Confidentiality, and therefore trust, can be broken when a person or an organisation can be identified in a disseminated dataset, either directly or indirectly.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges in making data publicly available is ensuring that no person or organisation is likely to be identified in the data. </p><p>Identification (often referred to as disclosure) occurs when someone learns something that they did not already know about another person or organisation through data that has been disseminated. This may be in the form of aggregate data (typically data presented in tables) or microdata (unit record data where each record represents observations for a person or an organisation). </p></div><div><h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3><p><strong>Microdata</strong> are unit record data containing individual responses to questions on survey questionnaires, or administrative forms. For example, data in response to the question ‘In what year were you born?’. </p><p><strong>Aggregate data</strong> (or macrodata) refers to aggregated microdata. For example, a count of the number of people of a particular age (obtained from the question ‘In what year were you born?’). </p></div></div></label></div><div><label class="image-toggle">How to confidentialise data: the basic principles<input type="checkbox"><div><p></p><div><p> Managing the risks of identification in disseminated data (also called disclosure control) involves taking steps to evaluate and mitigate the risk that the identity of a particular person or organisation may be disclosed. </p><p>Risks of identification can be managed by confidentialising data. The aim is to protect the identity of a person or an organisation, while at the same time maximising the usefulness of the data. </p><p>In simple cases, data can be manually confidentialised. However, the use of software is sometimes necessary. Specialised skills and knowledge of the data are also required to correctly confidentialise a dataset to minimise the risk of identification. </p><p>This information sheet outlines some common techniques for confidentialising data. The information is provided as a guide only and gives simple examples, using data presented in tables, to illustrate the concepts. However, most of the techniques apply to both aggregate and microdata. </p><p>Issues specific to the management of the confidentiality of microdata are discussed in Information sheet 5, ‘Managing the risk of disclosure in the release of microdata’. </p></div></div></label></div><div><label class="image-toggle">Managing the risk of disclosure in the release of microdata<input type="checkbox"><div><p></p><div><p> "As the world becomes more complex and computing capabilities increasingly advance, the role of microdata in statistics has become much more important.

If confidentiality issues are not fully addressed in constructive and proactive ways, users face the very real risk of losing access to high quality data</q><p></p><p>Source: Doyle P, Lane JW, Theeuwes JJM, Zayatz LM (2001) Confidentiality, disclosure and data access. Theory and practical applications for statistical agencies. North-Holland. </p><p>Confidentialisation techniques are applied to microdata (unit record data where each record represents observations for a person or organisation) to enable them to be made available to analysts and researchers. Without these techniques, access to valuable information for research and analytic purposes would be severely restricted. Although application of confidentialisation techniques generally leads to losses in information availability, when confidentialisation is done well and with knowledge of the key research objectives in mind, the information loss can be minimal. This fact sheet looks at the impact of confidentialisation on information availability for use in research and analysis. </p><p>There has always been a debate over the delicate balance between gaining full, unrestricted access to data (for researchers), and the application of confidentiality techniques to protect the privacy of data providers (by data custodians). Selecting the confidentiality techniques to be applied to microdata is a careful balance between fulfilling obligations to protect the identity of individuals and organisations and maximising the information available for statistical and research purposes. </p><p>The information required by the research sector is becoming more sophisticated over time. Increases in the use of techniques such as data linkage, data modelling, and data mining mean that researchers’ requirements are more detailed and more varied than ever before. As a consequence, there is more pressure on data custodians to provide greater access to microdata through high quality, detailed unit record files. </p><p>Users of microdata may be concerned that any reductions or changes made to datasets during the confidentialisation process may affect their ability to undertake analysis or research using the data, or may impact on the results of an analysis. However, generally very few changes need to be made to the dataset, and in most cases these have no impact on statistical analyses. </p><p>The goal of confidentialisation is to protect the identity of individual respondents. The main types of data cells affected when confidentialising a dataset are: </p><ul><li>rare events or characteristics;</li><li>unusual data (extreme high or low reported values); and</li><li>low count cross-classification cells.</li></ul><p>Generally, statistical analysis is based on observing trends and patterns in data, and most statistical techniques rely on multiple events or individuals with similar characteristics from which to draw inferences. Where there are multiple observations with similar characteristics, the risk of individual identification is low, and the confidentialisation process generally would not result in any change to the data. The low frequency events and unusual values that are targeted in confidentialisation procedures are generally not amenable to statistical analysis. </p></div></label></div></div></article></section></div><div><section class="section"><article class="section__content"><div class="previous-next"><div class="previous-next__link"><a class="previous-next__prev" href="data-integration/data-integration-projects/introduction.html"><div class="previous-next__title">Previous</div><div class="previous-next__page-title">Introduction</div></a></div><div class="previous-next__link"><a class="previous-next__next" href="data-integration/data-integration-projects/part-2.html"><div class="previous-next__title">Next</div><div class="previous-next__page-title">Part 2 - Understanding re-identification</div></a></div></div></article></section></div></div></div></div></article></div><div class="feedback"><p>Was this page helpful?<br><a href="mailto:support@data.gov.au?subject=User%20Guide%20%7C%20Confidentiality%20Information%20Series%20%7C%20Part%201">Send in feedback to help us improve</a></p></div></main><div class="back-to-top"><a class="back-to-top__button button button--primary button--icon-only icon--arrow-up" href="data-integration/data-integration-projects/part-1.html#">Back to the top</a></div><footer class="global__footer section section--top-l"><div class="section__content"><div class="global__footer__navigation section--bottom-xl" id="block-footer"><nav class="nav " role="navigation" aria-label="Footer"><ul><li><a href="https://www.data.gov.au/page/about">About</a></li><li><a href="https://www.data.gov.au/page/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.data.gov.au/page/recent-developments">Recent Developments</a></li><li><a href="mailto:support@data.gov.au">Contact Us</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></footer></div></div> </body></html>
