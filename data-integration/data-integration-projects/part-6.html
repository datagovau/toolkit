If the required variables of interest are available, Confidentialised Unit Record Files (CURFs) should be able to meet the needs of researchers. This is because the confidentiality techniques applied to these files are the same steps that analysts typically apply to the data to ensure robust outputs. That is:</p><ul><li>collapse cells with small counts;</li><li>collapse numeric values into groups;</li><li>recode variables with long tails (extreme high or low reported values); and</li><li>remove, or otherwise treat, outliers in distributions.</li></ul><p>For these types of analyses the outputs achieved using CURFs should not differ greatly from the results that would have been achieved using the original non-confidentialised unit record files.</p><h3 id="example:-how-does-confidentiality-affect-statistical-analysis?">Example: How does confidentiality affect statistical analysis?</h3><p>Professor David Lawrence, Telethon Institute of Child Health Research (TICHR)</p><h4>Case study: Cigarette smoking and anxiety disorders</h4><p>TICHR conducted a study using the ABS’ 2007 Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing expanded Confidentialised Unit Record File (CURF) to investigate the association between smoking and mental health problems. The expanded CURF was analysed through the Remote Access Data Laboratory (RADL). The RADL is a remote analysis environment where a client can submit analysis code to the data custodian, via the internet, and subsequently receive the output without ever having direct access to the unit record level information.</p><p>After the project was completed, an evaluation was conducted to determine whether the confidentiality techniques of perturbation and re-coding of variables (high and low data values) applied to the CURF had any effect on the results of the analysis. An ABS officer re-ran the analyses using the Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing master file (the original file before confidentialisation techniques were applied). The analysis included running several multi-way weighted tables of proportions, and fitting several logistic and proportional hazards regression models. Results from the study were published to three significant digits. None of the figures varied between the CURF and master file analyses at this level of precision.</p><p>Table 1 shows estimated hazard ratios for quitting smoking to five significant digits as obtained from performing the same analyses on both the expanded CURF and the original master file. The largest difference was observed at the level of 4 significant digits, and represented 1% of the standard error of the relevant estimate.</p><p>The minor changes between the CURF and master file analyses were of neither practical or statistical significance. This result is consistent with the very small level of change to the dataset during the confidentialisation process as described in the User’s Guide for the survey CURF.</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong> When our research on smoking and mental illness was run on the master file, the outputs were not practically different to those achieved using the expanded CURF. Therefore, the confidentiality techniques applied to the master file (perturbation and recoding of variables) did not affect the analyses conducted or the conclusions drawn from them during the project.</p><p>Full details of the weighted analyses and models undertaken for this project are described in: Lawrence D, Considine J, Mitrou F, Zubrick SR (2010) Anxiety disorders and cigarette smoking.

CURFs do not meet the data requirements for these studies as CURFs are de-identified and subject to confidentialisation techniques. Alternative approaches are needed. This may require the consent of the subjects involved to participate in this type of research.</p><h4>Example: A qualitative study of children born with a rare birth defect</h4><p>This type of study may aim to better understand what factors may have led to the occurrence of a rare birth defect, with the ultimate goal of preventing their occurrence or decreasing their incidence. Clearly these studies play an important role in understanding rare cases or phenomena, but they require an alternative approach to statistical analysis methods.</p><p> In this example, administrative microdata may be useful to identify potential participants in a more detailed study. The researcher would require special approval from the custodian to obtain the sensitive data records. This permission could be granted by a body such as a Human Research Ethics Committee constituted under the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).</p><p>Further to this, permission and further information may be needed from the parents of the child born with the rare birth defect. This type of research is best conducted by approaching the affected individuals and directly seeking their consent to participate in a research study. Statistical analysis of a microdata file, whether from a survey or an administrative data source, is rarely the most appropriate research design for this type of investigation.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>There are generally two types of research: quantitative and non-quantitative.</p><p>For quantitative research, data custodians are turning to a diverse range of products to meet researchers’ needs, including CURFs and data laboratories. Generally speaking, as the small changes that are made to unit record files during the confidentialisation process usually target unusual or extreme values only, the confidentiality techniques used to make the microdata available have little impact on the analyses performed in these types of studies. In many cases the small proportion of information that is lost from the original microdata has no impact on the question being analysed, and often similar steps would be taken by the researcher to prepare the data for the statistical analysis. As a result there will be little to no impact on the analysis using the confidentialised file compared to the original file.</p><p>For non-quantitative studies, such as examining unusual characteristics or small cohorts, or linking datasets, the current publicly available data products or methods are not able to meet the researcher’s needs. In these cases, researchers are required to complete a more rigorous application process. This may include sign-off from an ethics committee, permission from the data custodian, and possibly, permission from the data provider.</p><p>These types of data requests are increasing and researchers and data custodians will need to work together to come up with innovative ways to streamline access to datasets while ensuring that the confidentiality of the data provider is always respected and maintained. This is critical to ensuring the continuation of Australia’s high quality data collections.</p></div></article></section></div><div><section class="section"><article class="section__content"><div class="previous-next"><div class="previous-next__link"><a class="previous-next__prev" href="data-integration/data-integration-projects/part-5.html"><div class="previous-next__title">Previous</div><div class="previous-next__page-title">Part 5 - Managing the risk of disclosure: Treating Microdata</div></a></div><div class="previous-next__link"><a class="previous-next__next" href="data-integration/data-integration-projects/glossary.html"><div class="previous-next__title">Next</div><div class="previous-next__page-title">Glossary of Terms</div></a></div></div></article></section></div></div></div></div></article></div><div class="feedback"><p>Was this page helpful?<br><a href="mailto:support@data.gov.au?subject=User%20Guide%20%7C%20Confidentiality%20Information%20Series%20%7C%20Part%206">Send in feedback to help us improve</a></p></div></main><div class="back-to-top"><a class="back-to-top__button button button--primary button--icon-only icon--arrow-up" href="data-integration/data-integration-projects/part-6.html#">Back to the top</a></div><footer class="global__footer section section--top-l"><div class="section__content"><div class="global__footer__navigation section--bottom-xl" id="block-footer"><nav class="nav " role="navigation" aria-label="Footer"><ul><li><a href="https://www.data.gov.au/page/about">About</a></li><li><a href="https://www.data.gov.au/page/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.data.gov.au/page/recent-developments">Recent Developments</a></li><li><a href="mailto:support@data.gov.au">Contact Us</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></footer></div></div> </body></html>
