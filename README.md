# Australian Government Open Data Toolkit 
As published here [Open Data Toolkit](https://toolkit.data.gov.au/), this repository contains the files and pages that make up the Open Data Toolkit. 
This repository is managed by the [Digital Transformation Agency (DTA)](https://www.dta.gov.au).

In early 2019, the Open Data Toolkit was moved from hosting via MediaWiki to hosting via this github repository. The DTA intends to continue a shared approach to the upkeep and expansion of the open data toolkit. Should wish to make a contribution, please get in touch with the DTA Open Data Service via email to data@digital.gov.au .


## Contribute
Anyone can edit these pages, and ask the DTA to accept the changes into the website. 

This repository contains a number of HTML files with names match the url where the published. ie 
The file `Data_Integration_Projects_-_How_to_determine_the_risk_level_-_Risk_assessment_guidelines.html`
is published at "https://toolkit.data.gov.au/Data_Integration_Projects_-_How_to_determine_the_risk_level_-_Risk_assessment_guidelines.html" 

For small changes to text shown on these pages, and for users new to Github, the easy method is to open this page on github (it will look like this https://github.com/datagovau/toolkit-archive/blob/master/Data_Integration_Projects_-_How_to_determine_the_risk_level_-_Risk_assessment_guidelines.html) and then choose 'edit this page' (a pencil icon). 

Once you have made a change, you can add a brief description of your changes and save via 'Propose file change'. 

The contact person at the DTA will be notified of the proposed changes, and may review and accept the change. At this point, the change will appear in the public version of the toolkit. 

For more complex changes, you should get in touch with the DTA first to check that your proposed changes are aligned with other work that might be planned. When changing many files (or if testing is needed) it may be better to create a local copy of the site, make any required changes and then create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) to let the DTA know that there are a series of changes ready for review.
